## What is JAX?

JAX is a Python library for accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation,
designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning.

JAX can automatically differentiate native
Python and NumPy functions. It can differentiate through loops, branches,
recursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of
derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation)
via [`jax.grad`](#automatic-differentiation-with-grad) as well as forward-mode differentiation,
and the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.

JAX uses [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla)
to compile and scale your NumPy programs on TPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators.
You can compile your own pure functions with [`jax.jit`](#compilation-with-jit).
Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily.

Dig a little deeper, and you'll see that JAX is really an extensible system for
[composable function transformations](#transformations) at [scale](#scaling).

This is a research project, not an official Google product. Expect
[sharp edges](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html).
Please help by trying it out, [reporting bugs](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues),
and letting us know what you think!

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def predict(params, inputs):
  for W, b in params:
    outputs = jnp.dot(inputs, W) + b
    inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)  # inputs to the next layer
  return outputs                # no activation on last layer

def loss(params, inputs, targets):
  preds = predict(params, inputs)
  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)

grad_loss = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))  # compiled gradient evaluation function
perex_grads = jax.jit(jax.vmap(grad_loss, in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))  # fast per-example grads
```

## Transformations

At its core, JAX is an extensible system for transforming numerical functions.
Here are three: `jax.grad`, `jax.jit`, and `jax.vmap`.

### Automatic differentiation with `grad`

Use [`jax.grad`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#jax.grad)
to efficiently compute reverse-mode gradients:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def tanh(x):
  y = jnp.exp(-2.0 * x)
  return (1.0 - y) / (1.0 + y)

grad_tanh = jax.grad(tanh)
print(grad_tanh(1.0))
# prints 0.4199743
```

You can differentiate to any order with `grad`:

```python
print(jax.grad(jax.grad(jax.grad(tanh)))(1.0))
# prints 0.62162673
```

You're free to use differentiation with Python control flow:

```python
def abs_val(x):
  if x > 0:
    return x
  else:
    return -x

abs_val_grad = jax.grad(abs_val)
print(abs_val_grad(1.0))   # prints 1.0
print(abs_val_grad(-1.0))  # prints -1.0 (abs_val is re-evaluated)
```

See the [JAX Autodiff
Cookbook](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html)
and the [reference docs on automatic
differentiation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
for more.

### Compilation with `jit`

Use XLA to compile your functions end-to-end with
[`jit`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit),
used either as an `@jit` decorator or as a higher-order function.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def slow_f(x):
  # Element-wise ops see a large benefit from fusion
  return x * x + x * 2.0

x = jnp.ones((5000, 5000))
fast_f = jax.jit(slow_f)
%timeit -n10 -r3 fast_f(x)
%timeit -n10 -r3 slow_f(x)
```

Using `jax.jit` constrains the kind of Python control flow
the function can use; see
the tutorial on [Control Flow and Logical Operators with JIT](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/control-flow.html)
for more.

### Auto-vectorization with `vmap`

[`vmap`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap) maps
a function along array axes.
But instead of just looping over function applications, it pushes the loop down
onto the function’s primitive operations, e.g. turning matrix-vector multiplies into
matrix-matrix multiplies for better performance.

Using `vmap` can save you from having to carry around batch dimensions in your
code:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def l1_distance(x, y):
  assert x.ndim == y.ndim == 1  # only works on 1D inputs
  return jnp.sum(jnp.abs(x - y))

def pairwise_distances(dist1D, xs):
  return jax.vmap(jax.vmap(dist1D, (0, None)), (None, 0))(xs, xs)

xs = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(0), (100, 3))
dists = pairwise_distances(l1_distance, xs)
dists.shape  # (100, 100)
```

By composing `jax.vmap` with `jax.grad` and `jax.jit`, we can get efficient
Jacobian matrices, or per-example gradients:

```python
per_example_grads = jax.jit(jax.vmap(jax.grad(loss), in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))
```

## Scaling

To scale your computations across thousands of devices, you can use any
composition of these:
* [**Compiler-based automatic parallelization**](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html)
where you program as if using a single global machine, and the compiler chooses
how to shard data and partition computation (with some user-provided constraints);
* [**Explicit sharding and automatic partitioning**](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/explicit-sharding.html)
where you still have a global view but data shardings are
explicit in JAX types, inspectable using `jax.typeof`;
* [**Manual per-device programming**](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/shard_map.html)
where you have a per-device view of data
and computation, and can communicate with explicit collectives.

| Mode | View? | Explicit sharding? | Explicit Collectives? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto | Global | ❌ | ❌ |
| Explicit | Global | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manual | Per-device | ✅ | ✅ |

```python
from jax.sharding import set_mesh, AxisType, PartitionSpec as P
mesh = jax.make_mesh((8,), ('data',), axis_types=(AxisType.Explicit,))
set_mesh(mesh)

# parameters are sharded for FSDP:
for W, b in params:
  print(f'{jax.typeof(W)}')  # f32[512@data,512]
  print(f'{jax.typeof(b)}')  # f32[512]

# shard data for batch parallelism:
inputs, targets = jax.device_put((inputs, targets), P('data'))

# evaluate gradients, automatically parallelized!
gradfun = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))
param_grads = gradfun(params, (inputs, targets))
```

See the [tutorial](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/sharded-computation.html) and
[advanced guides](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/advanced_guide.html) for more.

A nascent version of JAX, supporting only automatic differentiation and
compilation to XLA, was described in a [paper that appeared at SysML
2018](https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2019/doc/2018/146.pdf). We're currently working on
covering JAX's ideas and capabilities in a more comprehensive and up-to-date
paper.
