# JAXCI Environment Variables

This docpage describes the various `JAXCI` environment variables that are used
in the CI scripts and their behaviors. These variables are used to control the
behavior of the CI scripts such as the Python version used, path to JAX/XLA
repo, if to clone XLA repo, etc.

This affects the Bazel commands only such as when building artifacts or when running the Bazel test scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_HERMETIC_PYTHON_VERSION&type=code)
`JAXCI_XLA_GIT_DIR`                         | Unset                                    | When using a local copy of XLA, this points to the root of the XLA git repoistory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_XLA_GIT_DIR&type=code)
`JAXCI_CLONE_MAIN_XLA`                      | 0                                        | If set to 1, the XLA repository is cloned at HEAD and its path is set in `JAXCI_XLA_GIT_DIR`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_CLONE_MAIN_XLA&type=code)

`JAXCI_OUTPUT_DIR`                          | `$(pwd)/dist`                            | Controls the location where the artifacts are written to. The directory will be automatically created if it does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_OUTPUT_DIR&type=code)
`JAXCI_BUILD_ARTIFACT_WITH_RBE`             | 0                                        | When set to 1, Bazel will use RBE to build the artifacts. Requires gcloud authentication and only certain platforms support RBE so this typically only set in CI builds                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_BUILD_ARTIFACT_WITH_RBE&type=code)
`JAXCI_WRITE_TO_BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE`         | 0                                        | When set to 1, Bazel will also try to push new cache entries to the cache bucket. Since writes to the bucket require authentication, this flag is enabled only for CI builds. Note that the builds using RBE use the RBE cache and not Bazel's remote cache, therefore this variable is a no-op if `JAXCI_BUILD_ARTIFACT_WITH_RBE` is set to 1. When `JAXCI_BUILD_ARTIFACT_WITH_RBE` and `JAXCI_WRITE_TO_BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE` are both not set, Bazel will still read from the public cache bucket to try to speed up the build. | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_WRITE_TO_BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE&type=code)
`JAXCI_ARTIFACT_TYPE`                       | "default"                                | Controls the type of artifacts to build. Valid values are "default", "release", "nightly". This affects the wheel tag and metadata, see [ci/build_artifacts.sh](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/ci/build_artifacts.sh) to understand how.                                                                                                            | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_ARTIFACT_TYPE&type=code)
`JAXCI_WHEEL_RC_VERSION`                    | Unset                                    | During the release process, we build a Release Candidate (RC) wheel in addition to the release wheel. This environment variable sets the version of the RC wheel to build. Values are set internally.                                                                                                                                                        | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_WHEEL_RC_VERSION&type=code)
`JAXCI_PYTHON`                              | `python${JAXCI_HERMETIC_PYTHON_VERSION}` | Points to the system Python binary to use. It used by scripts that make use of the system Python such as the Pytest scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_PYTHON&type=code)
`JAXCI_ENABLE_X64`                          | 0                                        | By default, JAX enforces single-precision numbers to mitigate the Numpy APIâ€™s tendency to aggressively promote operands to `double`. When set to 1, the tests will use double-precision numbers.                                                                                                                                                             | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_ENABLE_X64&type=code)
`JAXCI_TPU_CORES`                           | Unset                                    | Sets the number of TPU cores for the TPU machine type. Values are set in the workflow files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_TPU_CORES&type=code)
`JAXCI_RUN_FULL_TPU_TEST_SUITE`             | 0                                        | When set to 1, the full TPU test suite is run. Otherwise, a subset of tests is run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_RUN_FULL_TPU_TEST_SUITE&type=code)
`JAXCI_ADDITIONAL_WHEELS_INSTALL_FROM_PYPI` | Unset                                    | Used to control the installation of JAX [extras](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/7e42539653d33ec995487b683794c0bc86f7199b/setup.py#L64) from PyPI. See [ci/utilities/install_wheels_locally.sh](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/ci/utilities/install_wheels_locally.sh) for the list of valid values and their behavior.                                                                                                                    | [Usage](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajax-ml%2Fjax%20JAXCI_ADDITIONAL_WHEELS_INSTALL_FROM_PYPI&type=code)

## Docker Specific Environment Variables

> [!NOTE]
> The following environment variables only affect the build if the
> [run_docker_container.sh](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/ci/utilities/run_docker_container.sh)
> script was invoked to start a Docker container and the build is running inside
> that container. Typically, this would be the internal CI builds and local
> builds. Note that while GitHub actions use the same Docker images, they do not
> invoke "run_docker_container.sh" as they leverage built-in containerization
> features to run jobs within a container.
