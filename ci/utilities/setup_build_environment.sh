# Set up the build environment for JAX CI jobs. This script depends on the
# "JAXCI_" environment variables set or sourced in the build script.

# Pre-emptively mark the JAX git directory as safe. This is necessary for JAX CI
# jobs running on Linux runners in GitHub Actions. Without this, git complains
# that the directory has dubious ownership and refuses to run any commands.
# Avoid running on Windows runners as git runs into issues with not being able
# to lock the config file. Other git commands seem to work on the Windows
# runners so we can skip this step for Windows.
# TODO(b/375073267): Remove this once we understand why git repositories are
# being marked as unsafe inside the self-hosted runners.
