# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/<git hash>.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

    # For development, one often wants to make changes to the TF repository as well
    # as the JAX repository. You can override the pinned repository above with a
    # local checkout by either:
    # a) overriding the TF repository on the build.py command line by passing a flag
    #    like:
    #    python build/build.py build --local_xla_path=/path/to/xla
    #    or
    # b) by commenting out the http_archive above and uncommenting the following:
    # local_repository(
    #    name = "xla",
    #    path = "/path/to/xla",
    # )
