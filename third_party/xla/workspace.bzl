# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/<git hash>.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

# XLA_COMMIT = "eaa757692657a4882e35fd182224034a96ba5332"  # for testing
# XLA_SHA256 = "1e25b47323e45c97f2b5be2db1f675c6d4da01046df4e1d866cd838cbdceb571"

    # For development, one often wants to make changes to the TF repository as well
    # as the JAX repository. You can override the pinned repository above with a
    # local checkout by either:
    # a) overriding the TF repository on the build.py command line by passing a flag
    #    like:
    #    python build/build.py --bazel_options=--override_repository=xla=/path/to/xla
    #    or
    # b) by commenting out the http_archive above and uncommenting the following:
    # local_repository(
    #    name = "xla",
    #    path = "/path/to/xla",
    # )
