"""An example demonstrating how an FFI call can maintain "state" between calls

In this case, the ``counter`` call simply accumulates the number of times it
was executed, but this pattern can also be used for more advanced use cases.
For example, this pattern is used in jaxlib for:

1. The GPU solver linear algebra kernels which require an expensive "handler"
   initialization, and
2. The ``triton_call`` function which caches the compiled triton modules after
   their first use.
