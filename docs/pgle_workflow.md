**Title:** Add Documentation for PGLE Workflow in JAX

**Summary:**
This PR adds documentation for the PGLE (Pax Global Learning Environment) workflow in JAX, providing an overview of its purpose and a step-by-step guide on how to use it. PGLE enables efficient large-scale model training using JAX, particularly in distributed environments.

**Changes Introduced:**
- Created a new documentation page: `docs/pgle_workflow.md`.
- Added an introduction to PGLE, explaining its motivation and benefits.
- Included a step-by-step guide on running PGLE with JAX on GPUs.
- Provided references to relevant Paxml documentation.

**Motivation:**
Currently, JAX documentation does not cover PGLE, making it difficult for users to understand how to leverage it for large-scale training. This addition bridges that gap and provides clear guidance for users interested in PGLE.

**New Documentation Content (Excerpt):**

### PGLE Workflow in JAX

#### What is PGLE?
Pax Global Learning Environment (PGLE) is a framework for training large-scale models using JAX. It is designed to maximize efficiency in distributed training and offers advanced parallelization capabilities. PGLE is commonly used in combination with [Paxml](https://github.com/google/paxml), which provides structured model configurations and execution strategies.

#### Why Use PGLE with JAX?
- **Scalability:** Optimized for multi-GPU and TPU training.
- **Efficiency:** Improves model FLOP utilization.
- **Flexibility:** Works seamlessly with JAX’s functional programming paradigm.

#### Running PGLE with JAX on GPUs
To use PGLE with JAX, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install jax paxml flax optax
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   Ensure that JAX is set up to use GPUs:
   ```python
   import jax
   print(jax.devices())
   ```

3. **Set Up a PGLE Training Script**
   ```python
   from paxml import trainer
   trainer.run_experiment(config="your_config.py")
   ```

For a more detailed guide, see the [Paxml documentation](https://github.com/google/paxml).

**Testing & Verification:**
- Verified that the documentation renders correctly in Sphinx.
- Tested the provided commands on a JAX environment with GPU support.

**Next Steps:**
- Gather feedback from JAX maintainers.
- Expand the documentation with advanced PGLE configurations in future updates.

**Reviewer Notes:**
This is an initial draft; feedback is welcome on structure, clarity, and additional details that should be included.
