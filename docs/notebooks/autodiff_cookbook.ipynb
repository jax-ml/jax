In addition, the FLOP cost of the `jvp`-transformed function is about 3x the cost of just evaluating the function (one unit of work for evaluating the original function, for example `sin(x)`; one unit for linearizing, like `cos(x)`; and one unit for applying the linearized function to a vector, like `cos_x * v`). Put another way, for a fixed primal point $x$, we can evaluate $v \\mapsto \\partial f(x) \\cdot v$ for about the same marginal cost as evaluating $f$.\n",

If we apply a JVP to a one-hot tangent vector, it reveals one column of the Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the nonzero entry we fed in. So we can build a full Jacobian one column at a time, and to get each column costs about the same as one function evaluation. That will be efficient for functions with \"tall\" Jacobians, but inefficient for \"wide\" Jacobians.\n",

Building that matrix one column at a time, with each call taking a similar number of FLOPs to evaluate the original function, sure seems inefficient! In particular, for training neural networks, where $f$ is a training loss function and $n$ can be in the millions or billions, this approach just won't scale.\n",

If we have an $\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ function that just happens to use some complex-valued operations internally (some of which must be non-holomorphic, e.g. FFTs used in convolutions) then `grad` still works and we get the same result that an implementation using only real values would have given.\n",
