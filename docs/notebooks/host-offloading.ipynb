    "This implementation demonstrates how offloading model parameters together with activation offloading to host memory can significantly reduce device memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Memory Usage:**\n",
    "- Input tensor: 0.25 MB (256 × 256 × 4 bytes)\n",
    "- Model parameters (w1, w2): 10 MB each (256 × 1024 × 4 bytes ≈ 1 MB per layer × 10 layers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Usage Comparison:**\n",
    "- Argument size without parameter offloading: 20.25 MB (0.25 + 10 + 10)\n",
    "- Argument size with parameter offloading: 0.25 MB (only input remains)\n",
    "- Temporary memory without activation offloading: 17.25 MB\n",
    "- Temporary memory with activation offloading: 6.50 MB\n",
    "- Temporary memory with activation and parameter offloading: 4.75 MB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameter Offloading**: Moving parameters (w1, w2) to host memory reduces argument size by 20 MB (from 20.25 MB to 0.25 MB).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activation Offloading**: Moving activations to host memory reduces temporary memory usage by 10.75 MB (from 17.25 to 6.50 MB).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Strategy**: The rematerialization of activation offloading helps avoid keeping weights on the device and reduce temporary memory usage by 1.75 MB (from 6.50 MB to 4.75 MB). Without it, JAX would be eager to keep the on-device copies of the weights alive for the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Memory Savings**: 33.5 MB (20 MB + 10.75 MB + 1.75 MB)\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach demonstrates that parameter and activation offloading work synergistically to achieve significant memory reductions while maintaining computational correctness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Parameter Offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "{func}`jax.lax.scan` is crucial for effective parameter management. Using an explicit for loop would cause parameters to continuously occupy device memory, resulting in the same memory usage as without parameter offloading. While {func}`jax.lax.scan` allows specifying the scan axis, parameter offloading currently works only when scanning over axis 0. Scanning over other axes generates a `transpose` operation during compilation before returning parameters to the device, which is expensive and not supported on all platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The offloading performance can vary for different device types. It may degrade performance due to memory transfers between host and device, so it's important to consider this trade-off when designing your optimization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimizer State Offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizer state offloading is a memory management technique that stores optimizer states in host memory instead of device memory. This approach is particularly useful when optimizer states are large, as it reduces device memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic JAX implementation using the Adam optimizer can serve as a starting point, where all tensors are stored on the device. This will serve as a reference implementation before introducing optimizer state offloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section, let's implement a simple model with the Adam optimizer. This implementation helps establish the baseline behavior before exploring optimizer state offloading. It is particularly useful for understanding memory patterns in large-scale neural network training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example below, a neural network training loop is included to use JAX and Optax's Adam optimizer. The network consists of four linear layers with GELU activation functions, processing large matrices of size 7168x7168. The training process involves:\n",
    "- Forward pass: The input flows through four layers, each applying a linear transformation followed by GELU activation\n",
    "- Loss computation: Calculates mean squared error between output and input, plus L2 regularization\n",
    "- Backward pass: Computes gradients using automatic differentiation\n",
    "- Optimization step: Updates parameters using Adam optimizer with gradient clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses JIT compilation to optimize performance and includes memory usage analysis to monitor the computational resources required during training. The memory analysis provides insights into temporary memory usage, argument sizes, and total memory consumption during the optimization step."
