    "\n",
    "Activation offloading provides a powerful way to manage memory in large computations by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using checkpoint names to mark specific activations\n",
    "* Applying policies to control where and how activations are stored\n",
    "* Supporting common JAX patterns like scan operations\n",
    "* Moving selected activations to host memory when device memory is under budget\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly useful when working with large models that would otherwise exceed device memory capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parameters (also known as weights) can be offloaded to the host memory to optimize device memory usage during initialization. This is achieved by using {func}`jax.jit` with a sharding strategy that specifies host memory kind.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parameter Placement for Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the earlier `layer` function, {func}`jax.device_put` is applied to move parameter `w1` and `w2` to the device before the  matrix multiplications. This ensures the parameters are available on the device for both forward and backward passes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parameter Initialization with Host Offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "During the initialization, parameter `w1` and `w2` are placed on host memory before being passed to the {func}`jax.jit` function `f`, while keeping the `input` variable on the device."

    "\n",
    "{func}`jax.lax.scan` is crucial for effective parameter management. Using an explicit for loop would cause parameters to continuously occupy device memory, resulting in the same memory usage as without parameter offloading. While {func}`jax.lax.scan` allows specifying the scan axis, parameter offloading currently works only when scanning over axis 0. Scanning over other axes generates a `transpose` operation during compilation before returning parameters to the device, which is expensive and not supported on all platforms.\n",
