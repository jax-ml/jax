    "   operations. With this approach, transformations in the stack get applied as\n",
    "   we execute the Python callable as usual. This approach can be very tricky\n",
    "   to implement, but it's as general as possible because it allows\n",
    "   higher-order primitives not to raise the abstraction level of their\n",
    "   arguments and thus allows data-dependent Python control flow. We refer to\n",
    "   this approach as using a \"final-style higher-order primitive\" employing the\n",
    "   discharge-at-tracing-time \"final-style transformations\" we've used so far.\n",
    "2. **Staged processing, where `bind` takes a jaxpr as an argument.** Before we\n",
    "   call `bind`, in the primitive wrapper we can just use `make_jaxpr` to form\n",
    "   a jaxpr up-front and be done with the Python callable entirely. In this\n",
