# # Autodidax: JAX core from scratch
#
# <!--* freshness: { reviewed: '2024-04-08' } *-->
#
# Ever want to learn how JAX works, but the implementation seemed impenetrable?
# Well, you're in luck! By reading this tutorial, you'll learn every big idea in
# JAX's core system. You'll even get clued into our weird jargon!
#
# **This is a work-in-progress draft.** There are some important ingredients
# missing, still to come in parts 5 and 6 (and more?). There are also some
# simplifications here that we haven't yet applied to the main system, but we
# will.

# ## Part 1: Transformations as interpreters: standard evaluation, `jvp`, and `vmap`
#
# We want to transform functions that look like this:
#
# ```python
# def f(x):
#   y = sin(x) * 2.
#   z = - y + x
#   return z
# ```
#
# Think of functions like `sin` and the arithmetic operations underlying the
# infix operators (`mul`, `add`, and `neg`) as primitive operations, meaning
# atomic units of processing rather than compositions.
#
# "Transform" means "interpret differently." Instead of standard interpretation
# where we apply primitive operations to numerical inputs to produce numerical
# outputs, we want to override primitive application and let different values
# flow through our program. For example, we might want to replace the
# application of every primitive with an application of [its JVP
# rule](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html),
# and let primal-tangent pairs flow through our program. Moreover, we want to be
# able to compose multiple transformations, leading to stacks of interpreters.

# ### JAX core machinery
#
# We can implement stacks of interpreters and even have them all discharge on
# the fly as we execute the Python function to be transformed. To start, let's
# define these primitives so that we can intercept their application:

# +
from typing import NamedTuple

class Primitive(NamedTuple):
  name: str

add_p = Primitive('add')
mul_p = Primitive('mul')
neg_p = Primitive("neg")
sin_p = Primitive("sin")
cos_p = Primitive("cos")
reduce_sum_p = Primitive("reduce_sum")
greater_p = Primitive("greater")
less_p = Primitive("less")
transpose_p = Primitive("transpose")
broadcast_p = Primitive("broadcast")

def add(x, y): return bind1(add_p, x, y)
def mul(x, y): return bind1(mul_p, x, y)
def neg(x): return bind1(neg_p, x)
def sin(x): return bind1(sin_p, x)
def cos(x): return bind1(cos_p, x)
def greater(x, y): return bind1(greater_p, x, y)
def less(x, y): return bind1(less_p, x, y)
def transpose(x, perm): return bind1(transpose_p, x, perm=perm)
def broadcast(x, shape, axes): return bind1(broadcast_p, x, shape=shape, axes=axes)
def reduce_sum(x, axis=None):
  if axis is None:
    axis = tuple(range(np.ndim(x)))
  if type(axis) is int:
    axis = (axis,)
  return bind1(reduce_sum_p, x, axis=axis)

def bind1(prim, *args, **params):
  out, = bind(prim, *args, **params)
  return out


# -

# We'll set up array data types and infix operator methods in a moment.
#
# A `Primitive` is just an object with a name, to which we attach our
# interpretation rules (one for each transformation). The `bind` function is our
# interception point: it'll figure out which transformation rule to apply, based
# on how the arguments are boxed in tracers and what interpreters are active.
#
# The functions that user code calls, like `add` and `sin`, are just wrappers
# around calls to `bind`. These wrappers let us control how arguments are passed
# to `bind`, and in particular we follow a handy internal convention: when we
# call `bind`, we pass values representing array data as positional arguments,
# and we pass metadata like the `axis` argument to `reduce_sum_p` via keyword. This
# calling convention simplifies some core logic (since e.g. instances of the
# `Tracer` class to be defined below can only occur in positional arguments to
# `bind`). The wrappers can also provide docstrings!
#
# We represent active interpreters as a stack. The stack is just a simple
# `list`, and each element is a container with an integer level (corresponding
# to the element's height in the stack), an interpreter type (which we'll call a
# `trace_type`), and an optional field for any global data the interpreter
# needs. We call each element a `MainTrace`, though maybe "Interpreter" would be
# more descriptive.

# +
from collections.abc import Sequence
from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Any

class MainTrace(NamedTuple):
  level: int
  trace_type: type['Trace']
  global_data: Any | None

trace_stack: list[MainTrace] = []
dynamic_trace: MainTrace | None = None  # to be employed in Part 3

@contextmanager
def new_main(trace_type: type['Trace'], global_data=None):
  level = len(trace_stack)
  main = MainTrace(level, trace_type, global_data)
  trace_stack.append(main)

  try:
    yield main
  finally:
    trace_stack.pop()


# -

# When we're about to apply a transformation, we'll push another interpreter
# onto the stack using `new_main`. Then, as we apply primitives in the function,
# we can think of the `bind` first being interpreted by the trace at the top of
# the stack (i.e. with the highest level). If that first interpreter itself
# binds other primitives in its interpretation rule for the primitive, like how
# the JVP rule of `sin_p` might bind `cos_p` and `mul_p`, then those `bind`
# calls will be handled by the interpreter at the next level down.
#
# What goes at the bottom of the interpreter stack? At the bottom, we know all
# the transformation interpreters are finished, and we just want to do standard
# evaluation. So at the bottom we'll put an evaluation interpreter.
#
# Let's sketch out the interface for interpreters, which is based on the `Trace`
# and `Tracer` base classes. A `Tracer` represents a boxed-up value, perhaps
# carrying some extra context data used by the interpreter. A `Trace` handles
# boxing up values into `Tracers` and also handles primitive application.

  def pure(self, val): assert False  # must override
  def lift(self, val): assert False  # must override

  def process_primitive(self, primitive, tracers, params):
    assert False  # must override


# The first two methods are about boxing up values in `Tracer`s, which are the
# objects that flow through the Python programs we transform. The last method is
# the callback we'll use to interpret primitive application.
#
# The `Trace` itself doesn't contain any data, other than a reference to its
# corresponding `MainTrace` instance. In fact, multiple instances of a `Trace`
# might be created and discarded during an application of a transformation,
# whereas only a single `MainTrace` instance is created per application of a
# transformation.
#
# As for `Tracer`s themselves, each one carries an abstract value (and forwards
# infix operators to it), and the rest is up to the transformation. (The
# relationship between `Tracer`s and `AbstractValue`s is that there's one
# `Tracer` per transformation, and at least one `AbstractValue` per base type,
# like arrays.)

# Notice that we actually have two `AbstractValue`s for arrays, representing
# different levels of abstraction. A `ShapedArray` represents the set of all
# possible arrays with a given shape and dtype. A `ConcreteArray` represents a

  outs = top_trace.process_primitive(prim, tracers, params)

# The main action is that we call `find_top_trace` to figure out which
# interpreter should handle this primitive application. We then call that top
# trace's `process_primitive` so that the trace can apply its interpretation
# rule. The calls to `full_raise` just ensure that the inputs are boxed in the
# top trace's `Tracer` instances, and the call to `full_lower` is an optional
# optimization so that we unbox values out of `Tracer`s as much as possible.

# +

# -

# In words, ignoring the `dynamic_trace` step until Part 3, `find_top_trace`
# returns the highest-level interpreter associated with the `Tracer`s on its
# inputs, and otherwise returns the interpreter at the bottom of the stack
# (which is always an evaluation trace, at least for now). This is a deviation
# from the description above, where we always start by running the interpreter
# at the top of the stack and then work our way down, applying every interpreter
# in the stack. Instead, we're only applying an interpreter when the input
# arguments to a primitive bind are boxed in a `Tracer` corresponding to that
# interpreter. This optimization lets us skip irrelevant transformations, but
# bakes in an assumption that transformations mostly follow data dependence
# (except for the special bottom-of-the-stack interpreter, which interprets
# everything).
#
# An alternative would be to have every interpreter in the stack interpret every
# operation. That's worth exploring! JAX is designed around data dependence in
# large part because that's so natural for automatic differentiation, and JAX's
# roots are in autodiff. But it may be over-fit.

# The logic in `full_raise` serves to box values into `Tracer`s for a particular
# `Trace`, calling different methods on the `Trace` based on context:
# `Trace.pure` is called on non-`Tracer` constants, and `Trace.lift` is called
# for values that are already `Tracer`s from a lower-level interpreter. These
# two methods could share the same implementation, but by distinguishing them in
# the core logic we can provide more information to the `Trace` subclass.

# ## Pytrees and flattening user functions' inputs and outputs

# A limitation with `jvp_v1` is that it assumes the user function accepts arrays
# as positional arguments and produces a single array as output. What if it
# produced a list as output? Or accepted nested containers as inputs? It would
# be a pain to deal with all the possible containers in inputs and outputs at
# every layer of the stack. Instead, we can wrap the user function so that the
# wrapped version accepts arrays as inputs and returns a flat list of arrays as
# output. The wrapper just needs to unflatten its input, call the user function,
# and flatten the output.
#
# Here's how we'd like to write `jvp`, assuming the user always gives us
# functions that take arrays as inputs and produces a flat list of arrays as
# outputs:

def jvp_flat(f, primals, tangents):
  with new_main(JVPTrace) as main:
    trace = JVPTrace(main)
    tracers_in = [JVPTracer(trace, x, t) for x, t in zip(primals, tangents)]
    outs = f(*tracers_in)
    tracers_out = [full_raise(trace, out) for out in outs]
    primals_out, tangents_out = unzip2((t.primal, t.tangent) for t in tracers_out)
  return primals_out, tangents_out


# To support user functions that have arbitrary containers in the inputs and
# outputs, here's how we'd write the user-facing `jvp` wrapper:

def jvp(f, primals, tangents):
  primals_flat, in_tree = tree_flatten(primals)
  tangents_flat, in_tree2 = tree_flatten(tangents)
  if in_tree != in_tree2: raise TypeError
  f, out_tree = flatten_fun(f, in_tree)
  primals_out_flat, tangents_out_flat = jvp_flat(f, primals_flat, tangents_flat)
  primals_out = tree_unflatten(out_tree(), primals_out_flat)
  tangents_out = tree_unflatten(out_tree(), tangents_out_flat)
  return primals_out, tangents_out


# Notice that we had to plumb the tree structure of the user function output
# back to the caller of `flatten_fun`. That information isn't available until we
# actually run the user function, so `flatten_fun` just returns a reference to a
# mutable cell, represented as a thunk. These side-effects are safe because we
# always run the user function exactly once. (This safe regime is the reason for
# the "linear" name in `linear_util.py`, in the sense of [linear
# types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system).)
#
# All that remains is to write `tree_flatten`, `tree_unflatten`, and

# That's it for `jvp` and `vmap`!

# ## Part 2: Jaxprs
#
# The next transformations on the horizon are `jit` for just-in-time
# compilation and `vjp` for reverse-mode autodiff.  (`grad` is just a small
# wrapper around `vjp`.) Whereas `jvp` and `vmap` only needed each `Tracer` to
# carry a little bit of extra context, for both `jit` and `vjp` we need much
# richer context: we need to represent _programs_. That is, we need jaxprs!
#
# Jaxprs are JAX's internal intermediate representation of programs. They are
# explicitly typed, functional, first-order, and in ANF form. We need a
# program representation for `jit` because the purpose of `jit` is to stage
# computation out of Python. For any computation we want to stage out, we need
# to be able to represent it as data, and build it up as we trace a Python
# function. Similarly, `vjp` needs a way to represent the computation for the
# backward pass of reverse-mode autodiff. We use the same jaxpr program
# representation for both needs.
#
# (Building a program representation is the most
# [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_object) kind of
# trace-transformation, and so except for issues around handling native Python
# control flow, any transformation could be implemented by first tracing to a
# jaxpr and then interpreting the jaxpr.)

# ### Jaxpr data structures
#
# The jaxpr term syntax is roughly:
#
# ```
# jaxpr ::=
#   { lambda <binder> , ... .
#     let <eqn>
#         ...
#     in ( <atom> , ... ) }
#
# binder ::= <var>:<array_type>
# var ::= a | b | c | ...
# atom ::= <var> | <literal>
# literal ::= <int32> | <int64> | <float32> | <float64>
#
# eqn ::= <binder> , ... = <primitive> [ <params> ] <atom> , ...
# ```
#
# The syntax of types is:
#
# ```
# jaxpr_type ::= [ <array_type> , ... ] -> [ <array_type> , ... ]
# array_type ::= <dtype>[<shape>]
# dtype ::= f32 | f64 | i32 | i64
# shape ::= <int> , ...
# ```
#
# How do we represent these as Python data structures? We reuse ShapedArrays to
# represent types, and we can represent the term syntax with a few Python
# structs:

# +

  aval: ShapedArray

# We want to ensure that the `JaxprTrace` started by `make_jaxpr` is always

# `JaxprTracer` instances. We can achieve this by employing the `dynamic_trace`

# -

# Using `dynamic_trace` this way is conceptually the same as stashing the
# current interpreter stack and starting a new one with the `JaxprTrace` at the
# bottom. That is, no interpreters lower in the stack than the `dynamic_trace`
# are applied (since `JaxprTrace.process_primitive` doesn't call `bind`), though
# if the Python callable being traced to a jaxpr itself uses transformations
# then those can be pushed onto the interpreter stack above the `JaxprTrace`.
# But temporarily stashing the interpreter stack would break up the system
# state. The `dynamic_trace` tag achieves the same goals while keeping the
# system state simpler.

# That's it for jaxprs! With jaxprs in hand, we can implement the remaining
# major JAX features.

# ## Part 3: `jit`, simplified
#
# While `jit` has a transformation-like API in that it accepts a Python callable
# as an argument, under the hood it's really a higher-order primitive rather
# than a transformation. A primitive is _higher-order_ when it's parameterized
# by a function.

# ### On-the-fly ("final style") and staged ("initial style") processing
#
# There are two options for how to handle higher-order primitives. Each requires
# a different approach to tracing and engenders different tradeoffs:
# 1. **On-the-fly processing, where `bind` takes a Python callable as an
#    argument.** We defer forming a jaxpr until as late as possible, namely
#    until we're running the final interpreter at the bottom of the interpreter
#    stack. That way we can swap a `JaxprTrace` in at the bottom of the
#    interpreter stack and thus stage out rather than execute all primitive
#    operations. With this approach, transformations in the stack get applied as
#    we execute the Python callable as usual. This approach can be very tricky
#    to implement, but it's as general as possible because it allows
#    higher-order primitives not to raise the abstraction level of their
#    arguments and thus allows data-dependent Python control flow. We refer to
#    this approach as using a "final-style higher-order primitive" employing the
#    discharge-at-tracing-time "final-style transformations" we've used so far.
# 2. **Staged processing, where `bind` takes a jaxpr as an argument.** Before we
#    call `bind`, in the primitive wrapper we can just use `make_jaxpr` to form
#    a jaxpr up-front and be done with the Python callable entirely. In this
#    case, `make_jaxpr` puts its `JaxprTrace` at the top of the interpreter
#    stack, and no transformations lower in the stack, which might enter via
#    closed-over Tracers, are applied to the Python callable as we trace it.
#    (Transformations applied within the Python callable are applied as usual,
#    being added to the stack above the JaxprTrace.) Instead, the
#    transformations lower in the stack are later applied to the call primitive,
#    and the call primitive's rules must then transform the jaxpr itself.
#    Because we trace to a jaxpr up-front, this approach can't support
#    data-dependent Python control flow, but it is more straightforward to
#    implement. We refer to this kind of higher-order primitive as an
#    "initial-style higher-order primitive", and say that its jaxpr-processing
#    transformation rules are "initial-style transformation rules."
#
# The latter approach fits for `jit` because we don't need to support
# data-dependent Python control flow in the user-provided Python callable, as
# the whole purpose of `jit` is to stage computation out of Python to be
# executed by XLA. (In contrast, `custom_jvp` is a higher-order primitive in
# which we want to support data-dependent Python control flow.)
#
# Historically, we started using the "initial-style" and "final-style"
# terminology after reading the [typed tagless final
# interpreters](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/index.html) paper, and
# jokingly referring to JAX as an implementation of "untyped tagful final
# interpreters." We don't claim to carry over (or understand) any deep meaning
# behind these terms; we loosely use "initial style" to mean "build an AST and
# then transform it", and we use "final style" to mean "transform as we trace."
# But it's just imprecise yet sticky jargon.

# With the initial-style approach, here's the user-facing `jit` wrapper:

# to the XLA device, executing the XLA program, and transferring back the

# ## Part 4: `linearize` and `vjp` (and `grad`!)
#
# The `linearize` and `vjp` autodiff functions are built on `jvp`, but involve
# jaxprs as well. That's because both involve staging out, or delaying,
# computation.

# ### `linearize`
#
# In the case of `linearize`, we want to stage out the linear part of a `jvp`
# computation. That is, in terms of
# [Haskell-like type signatures](https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_signature),
# if we have `jvp : (a -> b) -> (a, T a) -> (b, T b)`,
# then we write `linearize : (a -> b) -> a -> (b, T a -o T b)`, using `T a` to
# mean "the tangent type of `a`" and using the "lollipop" `-o` rather than the
# arrow `->` to indicate a _linear_ function. We define the semantics of
# `linearize` in terms of `jvp` too:
# ```python
# y, f_lin = linearize(f, x)
# y_dot = f_lin(x_dot)
# ```
# gives the same result for `(y, y_dot)` as
# ```
# y, y_dot = jvp(f, (x,), (x_dot,))
# ```
# where the application of `f_lin` does not redo any of the linearization work.
# We'll represent the delayed linear part `f_lin : T a -o T b` as a jaxpr.
#
# Tangentially, now that we have linear arrows `-o`, we can provide a slightly
# more informative type for `jvp`:
# ```
# jvp : (a -> b) -> (UnrestrictedUse a, T a) -o (UnrestrictedUse b, T b)
# ```
# Here we're writing `UnrestrictedUse` just to indicate that we have a special
# pair where the first element can be used in an unrestricted (nonlinear) way.
# In conjunction with the linear arrow, this notation is just meant to express
# that the function `jvp f` uses its first input in a nonlinear way but its
# second input in a linear way, producing a corresponding nonlinear output
# (which can be used in a nonlinear way) paired with a linear output. This more
# refined type signature encodes the data dependencies in `jvp f`, which are
# useful for partial evaluation.
#
# To build the `f_lin` jaxpr from a JVP, we need to perform partial evaluation:
# we evaluate all the primal values as we trace, but stage the tangent
# computations into a jaxpr. This is our second way to build jaxprs. But where
# `make_jaxpr` and its underlying `JaxprTrace`/`JaxprTracer` interpreters aim
# to stage out every primitive bind, this second approach stages out only those
# primitive binds with a data dependence on tangent inputs.

# Now we turn to the general partial evaluation transformation. The goal is to
# accept a Python callable and a list of inputs, some known and some unknown,
# and to produce (1) all the outputs which can be computed from the known
# inputs, together with (2) a jaxpr representing the part of the Python
# callable's computation which can only be performed after the remaining inputs
# are known.
#
# This transformation is tricky to summarize in a type signature. If we
# assume the input function's type signature is `(a1, a2) -> (b1, b2)`, where
# `a1` and `a2` represent the known and unknown inputs, respectively, and where
# `b1` only has a data dependency on `a1` while `b2` has some data dependency on
# `a2`, then we might write
#
# ```
# partial_eval : ((a1, a2) -> (b1, b2)) -> a1 -> exists r. (b1, r, (r, a2) -> b2)
# ```
#
# In words, given values for the inputs of type `a1`, `partial_eval` produces
# the outputs of type `b1` along with "residual" values of
# existentially-quantified type `r` representing the intermediates required to
# complete the computation in the second stage. It also produces a function of
# type `(r, a2) -> b2` which accepts the residual values as well as the
# remaining inputs and produces the remaining outputs.
#
# We like to think of partial evaluation as "unzipping" one computation into
# two. For example, consider this jaxpr:
# ```
# { lambda a:float64[] .
#   let b:float64[] = sin a
#       c:float64[] = neg b
#   in ( c ) }
# ```
# A jaxpr for the JVP would look like:
# ```
# { lambda a:float64[] b:float64[] .
#   let c:float64[] = sin a
#       d:float64[] = cos a
#       e:float64[] = mul d b
#       f:float64[] = neg c
#       g:float64[] = neg e
#   in ( f, g ) }
# ```
# If we imagine applying partial evaluation to this jaxpr with the first input
# known and the second unknown, we end up 'unzipping' the JVP jaxpr into primal
# and tangent jaxprs:
# ```
# { lambda a:float64[] .
#   let c:float64[] = sin a
#       d:float64[] = cos a
#       f:float64[] = neg c
#   in ( f, d ) }
# ```
# ```
# { lambda d:float64[] b:float64[] .
#   let e:float64[] = mul d b
#       g:float64[] = neg e
#   in ( g ) }
# ```
# This second jaxpr represents the linear computation that we want from
# `linearize`.
#
# However, unlike in this jaxpr example, we want the computation on known values
# to occur while evaluating the input Python callable. That is, rather than
# forming a jaxpr for the entire function `(a1, a2) -> (b1, b2)`, staging all
# operations out of Python first before sorting out what can be evaluated now
# and what must be delayed, we want only to form a jaxpr for those operations
# that _must_ be delayed due to a dependence on unknown inputs. In the context
# of automatic differentiation, this is the feature that ultimately enables us
# to handle functions like `grad(lambda x: x**2 if x > 0 else 0.)`. Python
# control flow works because partial evaluation keeps the primal computation in
# Python. As a consequence, our `Trace` and `Tracer` subclasses must on the fly
# sort out what can be evaluated and what must be staged out into a jaxpr.
#
# First, we start with a `PartialVal` class, which represents a value that can
# be either known or unknown:

class PartialVal(NamedTuple):
  aval: ShapedArray
  const: Any | None

  @classmethod
  def known(cls, val: Any):
    return PartialVal(get_aval(val), val)

  @classmethod
  def unknown(cls, aval: ShapedArray):
    return PartialVal(aval, None)

  is_known   = property(lambda self: self.const is not None)
  is_unknown = property(lambda self: self.const is     None)


# Partial evaluation will take a list of `PartialVal`s representing inputs, and
# return a list of `PartialVal` outputs along with a jaxpr representing the
# delayed computation:

def partial_eval_flat(f: Callable, pvals_in: list[PartialVal]
                      ) -> tuple[Jaxpr, list[PartialVal], list[Any]]:
  with new_main(PartialEvalTrace) as main:
    trace = PartialEvalTrace(main)
    tracers_in = [trace.new_arg(pval) for pval in pvals_in]

    jaxpr, consts = tracers_to_jaxpr(unk_tracers_in, unk_tracers_out)
  return jaxpr, pvals_out, consts


# Next we need to implement `PartialEvalTrace` and its `PartialEvalTracer`. This
# interpreter will build a jaxpr on the fly while tracking data dependencies. To
# do so, it builds a bipartite directed acyclic graph (DAG) between
# `PartialEvalTracer` nodes, representing staged-out values, and `JaxprRecipe`
# nodes, representing formulas for how to compute some values from others. One
# kind of recipe is a `JaxprEqnRecipe`, corresponding to a `JaxprEqn`'s
# primitive application, but we also have recipe types for constants and lambda

# from `process_primitive`, which forms tracers with `JaxprEqnRecipe`s.

# For most primitives, the `process_primitive` logic is straightforward: if all

# representing unknown outputs, we need avals, which we get from the abstract
# eval rules. (Notice that tracers reference `JaxprEqnRecipe`s, and
# `JaxprEqnRecipe`s reference tracers; we avoid circular garbage by using
# `weakref`s.)
#
# That `process_primitive` logic applies to most primitives, but `xla_call_p`

# `a -> b -o c` to functions of type `a -> c -o b`. Even more generally, the
# inputs with respect to which the function is linear could be scattered through
# the argument list. So we indicate the linear positions using `UndefPrimal`.
# We register `UndefPrimal` as a pytree node because the pytree mechanism gives
# a handy way to prune these placeholders out of argument lists.

# ## Part 5: the control flow primitives `cond`
#
# Next we'll add higher-order primitives for staged-out control flow. These
# resemble `jit` from Part 3, another higher-order primitive, but differ in that
# they are parameterized by multiple callables rather than just one.

# ### Adding `cond`
#
# We introduce a `cond` primitive to represent conditional application of one
# function or another inside a jaxpr. We write the type of `cond` as
# `Bool -> (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> a -> b`. In words, `cond` takes a boolean
# representing the predicate and two functions of equal types. Depending on the
# value of the predicate, it applies one function or the other to its final
# argument.
#
# In Python, we represent it as a function which itself takes two functions as
# arguments. As with `jit`, the first step is to call `make_jaxpr` on its
# callable arguments to turn them into jaxprs:

# consistent the input binder lists of the two jaxprs. (To be more economical we
# could try to identify pairs of constants with the same shapes, but instead we

# Notice that we're not currently supporting the case where the predicate value
# itself is batched. In mainline JAX, we handle this case by transforming the
# conditional to a [select primitive](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.select.html).
# That transformation is semantically correct so long as `true_fun` and
# `false_fun` do not involve any side-effecting primitives.
#
# Another thing not represented here, but present in the mainline JAX, is that
# applying transformations to two jaxprs of equal type might result in jaxprs of
# different types. For example, applying the mainline JAX version of
# `vmap_jaxpr` to the identity-function jaxpr
#
# ```
# { lambda a:float32[] .
#   let
#   in ( a ) }
# ```
#
# would result in a jaxpr with a batched output, of type
# `[float32[10]] -> [float32[10]]` if the batch size were 10, while applying it
# to the zero-function jaxpr
#
# ```
# { lambda a:float32[] .
#   let
#   in ( 0. ) }
# ```
#
# would result in a jaxpr with an unbatched output, of type
# `[float32[10]] -> [float32[]]`. This is an optimization, aimed at not batching
# values unnecessarily. But it means that in `cond` we'd need an extra step of
# joining the two transformed jaxprs to have consistent output types. We don't
# need this step here because we chose `vmap_jaxpr` always to batch all outputs
# over the leading axis.
