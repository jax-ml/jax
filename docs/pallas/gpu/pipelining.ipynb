    "### Pipelining with Mosaic GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended approach to pipeline using Mosaic GPU is to use the `plgpu.emit_pipeline` function to pipeline over sequential loops (and to use `plgpu.kernel` to partition the problem in parallel over the CUDA grid). `emit_pipeline` follows a similar API as `pl.pallas_call` except it exposes a few additional GPU-specific options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `body`, `grid` have similar semantics as in `pl.pallas_call`. The `grid` denotes how many invocations of the `body` function to run. In contrast with a CUDA grid, the pipeline grid is guaranteed to run sequentially.\n",
    "- `in_specs` and `out_specs` also work similarly to `pl.pallas_call`, except they also accept `plgpu.BlockSpec` instances that can be used specify GPU-specific transforms, such as swizzling. See [memory reference transforms](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/gpu/reference.html#memory-reference-transforms) for more detail on available transformations.\n",
    "- `max_concurrent_steps` controls the maximum number of concurrent memory transfers. Using additional concurrent steps will consume more SMEM to hold temporary buffers, but it can improve the utilization of the memory subsystem. We recommend autotuning this parameter. Low values (e.g. 2) can sometimes achieve higher occupancy (due to lower SMEM usage) which can improve throughput in ALU-heavy kernels, but will introduce more noise due to the hardware taking care of scheduling. Larger values (between 4 and 6) will work best for kernels that can't take advantage of extra occupancy\n",
    "- `delay_release` allows the user to specify an additional number of iterations to wait before the buffer is re-used by the pipeline. For example, a buffer copied into SMEM on iteration 0 with `delay_release=1` and `max_concurrent_steps=2` will not be re-used until iteration 3, as opposed to iteration 2 for a standard double-buffered strategy. `delay_release=1` is necessary if you don't await a `plgpu.wgmma` operation on the pipeline operands, as otherwise the pipeline will begin overwriting the buffers while the WGMMA is still reading them. This is useful for certain optimizations such as allowing multiple async matmuls in flight to keep the tensor core pipeline filled, but care must be taken when using such a strategy as **omitting this parameter will silent data races**, and it reduces the efficiency of `emit_pipeline` as we are overlapping fewer memory transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compatibility API using `pl.pallas_call`\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to `emit_pipeline` and to maintain compatibility with Pallas TPU, Mosaic GPU also implements the existing `pl.pallas_call` API. By default, `pl.pallas_call` on Mosaic GPU will partition your kernel in parallel over the CUDA grid. You can opt-in to pipelining by passing in a `plgpu.CompilerParams` object as the `compiler_params` argument, which specifies the following options that are relevant for pipelining:\n",
    "- `dimension_semantics`: A tuple of `Literal['parallel', 'sequential']` that specifies iteration semantics for each grid dimension. `parallel` will partition the corresponding dimension over the CUDA grid, and `sequential` dimensions will be pipelined sequentially. **Note that if no dimensions are marked `sequential`, no pipelining will happen!**\n",
    "- `max_concurrent_steps`: identical to the option in `plgpu.emit_pipeline`.\n",
    "- `delay_release`: identical to the option in `plgpu.emit_pipeline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelining lets you re-use scratch buffers across the sequential iterations of the grid (e.g. for implementing reductions). Additionally, `pallas_call` supports using `plgpu.BlockSpec` objects in place of `pl.BlockSpec` objects when using the Mosaic GPU backend, allowing you to specify GPU-specific memory transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that users use `plgpu.kernel` rather than `pl.pallas_call` as `plgpu.kernel` supports more features (such as specifying the number of warpgroups and warp specialization).\n"

    "### Warp Specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Warp specialization is a technique where we program each warp/warpgroup to perform a single task in order to give the GPU hardware the flexibility to schedule them at runtime. Recall that each streaming multiprocessor (SM) in a GPU contains warp schedulers that can swap execution between warps, so for example when one warp is stalling it can begin executing a different warp. In practice, this can be more performant than programming a single instruction stream where the compiler must statically schedule the operations and attempt to overlap them optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are interested in warpgroup specialization on Hopper+ GPUs, where it can be useful to have a separate warpgroup issuing TMAs (GMEM/SMEM copies) from the warpgroups performing arithmetic, since indexing calculations and issuing TMAs can take up a significant amount of time and potentially leave the TensorCore idle. The figure below depicts a standard, non-specialized kernel on the left where TMAs (async copies) and matrix multiplication are issued from a single instruction stream, and a warp-specialized version on the right where communication and arithmetic are handled on separate warpgroups. A *consumed barrier* is used to synchronize between the specialized warpgroups that signals to the memory warpgroup when it is safe to begin the next TMA.\n",
