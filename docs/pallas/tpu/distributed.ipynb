    "# Distributed Computing in Pallas for TPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of distributed computing in Pallas on TPUs. We will learn about TPU topologies, communication using the remote DMA primitive, and calling a distributed kernel from JAX using `jax.shard_map`. We will also cover some more advanced kernel writing techniques, such as double-buffering, bi-directional bandwidth optimization, and nested pipelining. As educational examples, we will learn how to implement various collective primitives from JAX, such as `lax.ppermute`, `lax.all_gather`, `lax.psum`, and `lax.psum_scatter`.\n",

    "## TPU Topologies\n",
    "\n",
    "TPUs are typically deployed in pods of multiple devices connected via a high-bandwidth interchip interconnect (ICI) for communication within the pod that is much faster than a typical network connection. For example, the specifications sheet for a [TPU v5p](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v5p) states an ICI bandwidth of 4.8Tb/s per chip (for reference, TPU v5p also has 21Tb/s of *local* HBM bandwidth). The ICI allows us to implement fast and performant distributed kernels that require high-bandwidth communication within a pod, and use the datacenter network for parallelization over less bandwidth-intensive operations, such as data-parallelism over a batch dimension.\n",

    "Flattened as a graph, the torus can be visualized as follows. Each edge (orange or black) is a bidirectional connection between two devices. You will commonly hear about rings in conjunction with discussion about device topologies — a key feature of a torus is that when taking a slice along an axis of the pod, such as the nodes `[(0,1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]` or `[(0, 1), (1, 1)]`, we have a ring of devices. This is a feature we can use to simplify communication patterns within the pod.\n",

    "TPUs communicate via a push-only model known as a remote direct memory access (RDMA). A TPU is allowed to issue copy instruction to push from a local buffer to any buffer on another device within the same pod that executes asynchronously from the main program thread. However, a TPU can only read data that is stored locally. This is in contrast to more traditional multi-core programming where it is possible to both read from and write to values to a shared memory.\n",

    "- `src_ref` is the local `Ref` (in any memory space) containing the data you wish to send to `dst_ref` on another device.\n",
    "- `dst_ref` is the remote `Ref` (in any memory space) at which data will be copied to on the target device.\n",
    "- `send_sem` is a DMA semaphore used to block until all data has been sent from `src_ref`.\n",
    "- `recv_sem` is a DMA semaphore used to block until the expected number of bytes have been received at `dst_ref`. The sender of the DMA will write to the receiver's `recv_sem`.\n",

    "`make_async_remote_copy` returns a descriptor object on which you use the `.start()` method to initiate the DMA, and the `.wait_send()` to block on `send_sem` and `.wait_recv()` to block on `recv_sem` (or `.wait()` to block on both). If a device is only expected to send data, it is sufficient to only call `.start()` and `.wait_send()`, and likewise if a device is only receiving it is sufficient to only call `.wait_recv()`. If using a SPMD pattern where all devices execute the DMA, each device will generally call both `.start()` and `.wait()`.\n",

    "### DMA Semaphores\n",
    "\n",
    "`send_sem` and `recv_sem` are instances of a special type of semaphore reserved exclusively for use with DMAs. They must be allocated with the `tpu.SemaphoreType.DMA` type when specifying input specs to `pallas_call`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, DMA semaphores can be thought of as integer-valued progress trackers. On DMA start, the local device will begin to increment the value of `send_sem` and the receiver's `recv_sem` asynchronously. Waiting on a semaphore will block until the value of the semaphore reaches the total bytes of data sent/received; when the value is reached, waiting threads are released and the semaphore's value is decremented by the same amount. This means that either all data has been sent (for `send_sem`) or all data has been received (for `dst_sem`). The value of the semaphore can be read with `pl.semaphore_read`, but note that the underlying semantics of the value could change between hardware generations (e.g. the value may not represent exactly the number of bytes sent, although this is a useful mental model to have when reasoning about the behavior of the semaphore).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "A sender is allowed to send data to any receiver within the same pod, even if they do not share a direct connection (the exception to this rule is for TPU v5e, where devices can only route to a power of 2 offset from themselves). TPUs have an internal routing mechanism which can pass data along to the next device on the path to the destination. However, communicating in this way is not recommended as you have no control over network contention as a kernel writer. The examples we will cover in this tutorial minimize inefficient communication by only transferring data to neighboring devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure modes\n",
    "\n",
    "If using remote DMAs incorrectly, you may encounter several failure modes which can be difficult to debug. The general symptoms of buggy DMA usage are crashes, hanging, or silent data corruption:\n",
    "- If semaphores exit the program with an invalid non-zero value, Pallas will crash and exit the program.\n",
    "- If semaphores are waited on but an insufficient number of bytes are received (i.e. there is no sender, or if the sent data is less than the size of `dst_ref` on the receiving device), the program may hang indefinitely waiting for bytes that are never sent. In this case the program would need to be restarted.\n",
    "- If encountering a race condition, there could be silent data corruption if two simultaneous writes or a simultaneous read and write occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common causes of the above include:\n",
    "- If a device calls `.wait_recv()` but no other device sends to it, the kernel may hang.\n",
    "- If a device is sent a more bytes than it expected to receive, it may also crash due to non-zero semaphore states. If sent less, it may hang indefinitely.\n",
    "- If DMAs are started but the semaphores are not waited on, the program may crash due to non-zero semaphore states.\n",
    "- If two devices copy to the same destination, you may encounter non-deterministic results due to a race condition, or crashing due to  non-zero semaphore states."

    "### Example: Right Permute (`lax.ppermute`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into a very basic example. We will implement a kernel that performs a right permutation, where each device sends its slice of the data to its right neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had an array with 512 elements, which we shard into slices of size 128 across 4 devices. Each device will pass its slice to the next device, and the output will consist of the same data, but with the slices rotated by 1. This is identical to the `lax.ppermute` operation where the permutation is set to `(n, (n+1) % 4)`.\n",
    "\n",

From there, we can write the kernel the same way as you would write a normal single-device Pallas kernel, except we now have access to remote DMA instructions. JAX collective primitives such as `lax.axis_index` can be used to obtain a `device_id` that can be used to compute which target devices to copy to, by referencing the same named axes names passed into `shard_map`."

    "In this next example we will implement the all-gather collective operation, which has a JAX equivalent in `lax.all_gather`. In contrast with the right-permute example from above which only involves a pair of source and destination neighbors, an all-gather operation requires communication between all devices and therefore we must think about how data is routed between them. The specifics of how we implement this are dictated by the device topology, for which we assume is a ring.\n",

    "A detail worth mentioning here is the use of multiple receive semaphores. Because we only block on the receiving device, it is still possible for a sender to have sent multiple DMAs in flight before the receiver has finished processing the first one (see the next section and reduce-sum example which discusses race conditions in more detail). In this situation we may hit a situation where the same semaphore is being used for multiple DMAs occurring simultaneously. To avoid this, we allocate `num_devices-1` semaphores so there is no risk of reuse. While this race condition is unlikely to happen on such a small kernel, on larger kernels there is more chance for devices to fall out of sync and potentially cause a silent failure."

    "### Synchronization: Regular and Barrier Semaphores\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples we implemented in the basic tutorial do not require special handling of synchronization as all necessary communication writes to disjoint buffers. However, other operations may require more complex communication patterns that need additional synchronization primitives to avoid race conditions. Pallas provides two additional primitives to help with this: regular and barrier semaphores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regular Semaphores\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular semaphores are the standard tool used to synchronize across multiple devices. Semaphores are fundamentally counters - they can be incremented by any device after which a device can block until the value of the semaphore reaches a specific value (and then decrement the value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main operations that can be used on regular semaphores are signal, wait, and read:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def semaphore_signal(\n",
    "    sem: Ref[SemaphoreType],\n",
    "    inc: int,\n",
    "    device_id: int | tuple[int, ...],\n",
    "    device_id_type: DeviceIdType\n",
    ") -> None:\n",
    "  ... # Increments the semaphore `sem` on the target device `device_id` by `inc`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "def semaphore_wait(\n",
    "    semaphore: Ref[SemaphoreType],\n",
    "    value: int,\n",
    ") -> None:\n",
    "  ... # Blocks until the locally allocated copy of `sem` reaches `value`, then decrement by `value` and proceed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "def semaphore_read(\n",
    "    sem: Ref[SemaphoreType],\n",
    ") -> jax.Array:\n",
    "  ...  # Returns the current value of `sem` as an `int32[]`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use regular semaphores, they can be allocated in the same way as a DMA semaphore, but by specifying `pltpu.SemaphoreType.REGULAR` rather than `pltpu.SemaphoreType.DMA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semaphores must be zero at the end of a Pallas program to complete successfully. There are two error cases where this may happen:\n",
    " - If a semaphore is over-signaled, the program will end with non-zero (>0) semaphores. In this case, the program will crash upon completion. This is useful for debugging as non-zero semaphores typically means there is a bug somewhere inside of the program.\n",
    " - If a semaphore is over-waited, the program will hang on the blocking `semaphore_wait` call while it waits for the semaphore to be incremented. In this case the device or program will need to be restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Barrier Semaphores\n",
    "\n",
    "Barrier semaphores are globally-allocated semaphores used to synchronize devices across an entire program and ensure that all devices have entered the Pallas kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Pallas kernel is executed within the context of a larger XLA program, we need to ensure that all devices that communicate have entered the kernel. However, DMA and regular semaphores are both locally scoped - they are only understood by other devices that have entered the kernel. Barrier semaphores serve as a globally understood semaphore that can be used for synchronization no matter where in the XLA program the device is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if you do not specify a barrier semaphore, Pallas will automatically insert a barrier semaphore at the beginning of your program. However, it can be more efficient to write your own. Barrier semaphores are similar to regular semaphores in that they are counters that can be incremented via `semaphore_signal` and can be decremented via `semaphore_wait`. They are created by calling `get_barrier_semaphore()` within a kernel. Typically, we use barriers once at the beginning of a kernel to synchronize with all devices we are communicating with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from jax.experimental.pallas import tpu as pltpu\n",
    "\n",
    "def example_kernel(...):\n",
    "  # Use barrier semaphores at the beginning of a kernel.\n",
    "  # is_start_of_kernel = ...\n",
    "  # right_neighbor = ...\n",
    "  # ...\n",
    "  @pl.when(is_start_of_kernel)\n",
    "  def _():\n",
    "    barrier_sem = pltpu.get_barrier_semaphore()\n",
    "    # Increment the semaphore of your right neighbor.\n",
    "    pltpu.semaphore_signal(\n",
    "          barrier_sem,\n",
    "          device_id=right_neighbor,\n",

    "    pltpu.semaphore_wait(barrier_sem, 1)\n",
    "  # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using barrier semaphores, the `collective_id` compiler parameter must be passed to `pallas_call` to specify which barrier semaphore is being used. A TPU has a small, fixed number of barrier semaphores available (typically on the order of 20-30) and therefore they should be used sparingly. In order to ensure correctness, only kernels that share the same communication pattern should use the same `collective_id`. For example, if two kernels synchronize only with neighbors on the same mesh axis, they are allowed to share the same `collective_id`. However, if two kernels synchronize along different axes, they must have different `collective_id`s. Failure to do so may result in race conditions that are difficult to debug.\n",

    "### Double-buffering\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid reading from a local `Ref` that is also being written into by another device and creating a race condition, a useful technique is the \"double-buffered\" strategy where we allocate a two `Ref`s for each destination value. On each iteration, one `Ref` will be designated as a \"working\" slot, and the other will be designated as a \"receiving\" slot. The device is free to use the working slot for computation, but will only copy data into its neighbor's receiving slot. The working and receiving slots alternate every iteration, so that once a copy is finished, the old receiving slot becomes the new working slot, and vice versa. Using this scheme properly, data is never read from and written to the same buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code skeleton demonstrates how double-buffering can be used. We keep a running iteration counter in the variable `iteration`, and the `working_slot` and `receiving_slot` alternate between 0 and 1 every iteration. `dst_ref` is allocated as a double-buffer and has the size `[2, ...]`. On each iteration, we read from the working slot using `dst_ref.at[working_slot, ...]` and use the value to perform computation. Simultaneously, we copy to our neighbor's `dst_ref.at[receiving_slot]` to avoid overwriting their `working_slot` value. By structuring our communication in this fashion it is possible to overlap the communication latency of the remote DMA with local computation while minimizing the risk of race conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of synchronization, the double-buffered construction works if all devices are executing on the same iteration. If a sender manages to get one iteration ahead of its receiver, it's `working_slot` and `receiving_slot` indices will be flipped compared to the receiver, meaning that it could be writing into the `working_slot` at the same time the receiver is reading from it. In order to avoid this, it may be necessary to use a semaphore to synchronize the sender with the receiver, or add additional buffering slots (\"triple\", \"quadruple\", or N-buffered) to allow additional run-ahead at the cost of more memory. In our previous `all_gather` example, note that the kernel contained a receiving buffer with N slots, which avoids race conditions altogether. In our next kernel, we will instead go through an example which uses a double-buffer with explicit synchronization."

    "### Example: All-Reduce Sum (`lax.psum`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now implement an all-reduce sum kernel using double-buffering and semaphores for synchronization. For those familiar with collective operations in JAX, the equivalent operation is `lax.psum`. All-reduce is a standard collective operation where the objective is to reduce along an axis of an array, but the array is sharded across multiple devices.\n",

    "\n",
    "The naive implementation of all-reduce would be to gather all required values onto each device, and then reduce. However, we can improve the performance of this implementation by interleaving communication with computation. An interleaved, single-direction all-reduce can be visualized as follows. On each iteration, we receive an input value from our left neighbor, and concurrently pass input along to our next neighbor while incrementing it with our local accumulator. After N-1 iterations, each device will have a copy of the full sum in it's memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following kernel demonstrates how to combine these principles into a functional kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prologue (executed when `outer_step==0`) first initiates a barrier with both neighbors to ensure that they have also entered the kernel. It also handles initialization for all `Ref`s and handles the first remote copy to the right neighbor's \"working\" slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main body assumes that a value has already been copied into our local working slot, either from the previous iteration or from the prologue. A complicating factor is that our destination buffers live in HBM, but we need to load values to VMEM before we perform arithmetic. Therefore, we simultaneously copy the working slot value into our VMEM (`receive_scratch`) and pass the value on to our right neighbor's receiving slot. Once the value has been copied into our VMEM, we can accumulate it into our result (contained in `o_ref`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtle race condition can occur if one device runs one loop ahead of it's right neighbor. In this case, it could copy into the receiver's `working_slot` at the same time the receiver is reading from it. In order to avoid this, each device will block on a `REGULAR` semaphore before copying into the right neighbor's `dst_ref` until it has signaled that it is done reading from its `working_slot`. This race condition is rarely triggered for a small kernel such as this example, but can it can be explicitly triggered if for example using a `pltpu.delay` instruction to artificially hang a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is not an optimal or fully general kernel, as the block sizes must entirely fit in VMEM and we could better interleave communication and accumulation. We will discuss these optimizations in later sections."

    "### Run-ahead and Race Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb, to maximize performance we want to allow a device to run-ahead of other devices without synchronization as much as possible without sacrificing correctness of the program. While we could enforce a barrier across all devices at the beginning of each iteration, this bottlenecks the performance of the program to the slowest device on each loop. By relaxing synchronization and allowing a moderate amount of run-ahead, we can better accommodate variance in latency between iterations and devices because a device that is slow on one iteration could catch up on the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the all-reduce kernel we wrote previously, we allow devices to run ahead but by less than one iteration compared to its neighbors (however, non-neighboring devices could be more than 1 iteration apart). To see why the semaphore synchronization is necessary, consider the case when one device (say device 2) hangs and falls behind the other devices. An RDMA has no \"handshake\" — only the receiver is blocked while waiting for the data to arrive. Therefore, each device can run up to one iteration ahead before it becomes blocked waiting for the next RDMA to arrive. If we have N devices, this means that the final device can be up to N iterations ahead of the first device.\n",
    "\n",
    "![race_condition](../../_static/pallas/distributed/race_condition.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without adding synchronization in the other direction (forcing senders to block), device 1 could potentially run up to `N` iterations (`N = num_devices`) ahead of device 2, sending multiple writes and overwriting values in the process. To solve this in the `all_reduce` kernel we wrote previously we implemented a \"handshake\" protocol where the receiver signals back to the sender that it is ready to receive, and only then does the sender begin issuing the next RDMA."

    "### Example: Bi-directional Reduce-Scatter (`lax.psum_scatter`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A reduce-scatter operation is the combination of an all-reduce followed by a scatter. Or alternatively, an all-reduce is the combination of a reduce-scatter followed by all-gather.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graphic depicts the semantics of this operation. We assume that each device starts with a collection of partial sums (denoted by a letter + number, such as `A0`). The goal is to reduce along one axis (numbers), while sharding along the other axis (letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "![reduce_scatter_1](../../_static/pallas/distributed/reduce_scatter_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement a bi-directional communication strategy, we slice each input block in half, and designate a direction for each half. The top half of each block will be passed from right-to-left, and the bottom half will be passed from left-to-right. A second deviation from the communication patterns of our previous all-reduce and all-gather kernels is that we will also pass around accumulators or partial sums and keep the inputs local to each device. This is in contrast to the previous examples where we passed around inputs but kept the accumulator local to the device. Passing around the accumulator is a more natural fit for this problem as in contrast to all-reduce, most of the data in the inputs are not part of the output that will be stored locally on the device. (e.g. `B0`, `C0`, and `D0` in the above graphic will not be stored on the device holding `A` at the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates this communication pattern, where the colored boxes represent accumulators (not inputs!). Initially, the accumulator is simply the value that was contained in the input. At each iteration of the algorithm, we will receive a partial sum from our neighbors in each direction. We then compute the correct slice of our input to accumulate into the partial buffer, then pass the new partial sum along to our next neighbor. After N iterations, the accumulator will have passed through each device, meaning that it will hold the full sum in the end.\n",

    "In terms of construction of the kernel, we introduce an additional `phase` dimension to the Pallas grid, which denotes which accumulator (left or right) we are currently computing on. We let `phase=0` denote the accumulator moving to the left, and `phase=1` denote the accumulator moving to the right. We then pipeline the two phases, such that while computing the result for one phase we are transferring our previously computed values in the opposite direction in preparation for the next phase. For example, when we are on `phase=0` (left), we first begin a DMA to transfer results we computed in the previous iteration to our right neighbor (right-DMA). Then, we accumulate into the left-buffer and save the result to HBM. We then wait for the right-DMA to complete so that it is ready for `phase=1` (right)."

    "### Nested Remote and Local DMA Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of the previous all-reduce and reduce-scatter kernels that we wrote is that the blocks we copy via remote DMA must be small enough to fit in our working VMEM that we use for accumulation. For some kernels it may be advantageous to use larger block sizes to better utilize the TPU. For example, a matrix multiplication requires on the order of $O(N^3)$ compute operations, but only $O(N^2)$ memory transfers. Therefore, we want each block of work transferred between devices to be large enough such that the operation becomes compute bound and we can hide the communication cost using pipelining. For reference, the VMEM of a TPU (for generations v4/v5) is typically on the order of 10-100MB, whereas HBM ranges from 10-100GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, we need to be able to write an \"inner kernel\" that handles local HBM-VMEM pipelining inside of the \"outer kernel\" that handles pipelining larger HBM-HBM transfers between devices. Pallas offers an API for constructing nested pipelines using the `emit_pipeline` function. The basic call signature for `emit_pipeline` follows that of a standard `pallas_call` by specifying a `grid` and `BlockSpec`s for the inputs and outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def emit_pipeline(\n",
    "    kernel: Callable,\n",
    "    grid: tuple[int],\n",

    ") -> Callable:\n",
    "  ... # Returns a custom pipeline given an inner kernel and BlockSpecs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, one can view `pallas_call` itself as simply a wrapper around `emit_pipeline`. Because our outer kernel only involves remote HBM-HBM transfers, we are not using any of the built-in pipelining that `pallas_call` provides for HBM-VMEM transfers. The following code skeleton demonstrates what a typical program structure would look like using this pattern:\n",

    "### Example: Reduce-Scatter with large HBM blocks\n",

    "In this next example we will modify our previous reduce-scatter example to utilize a nested inner pipeline. Note that the communication and computation costs of `reduce_scatter` both scale linearly with the size of the input, so we do not necessarily expect to see the operation become compute-bound with larger block sizes. This example is purely for demonstration purposes on how to use the pipeline emitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will increase the block sizes of the outer kernel such that they would be undesirable to place inside of VMEM, and allocate all inputs and outputs in HBM (`memory_space=MemorySpace.ANY`). The only major change from our previous kernel is the body of the kernel where accumulation is done. Rather than manually copying from HBM to VMEM, accumulating, and copying back to HBM, we use `emit_pipeline` to handle the memory transfers for us. Accumulation is done in an inner kernel with a much smaller, VMEM-friendly block size.\n",

    "## Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Megacore\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain TPUs contain multiple cores in a [Megacore](pallas_tpu_megacore) configuration. In this configuration, our general recommendation is to only initiate DMAs from a single core, and only perform HBM-HBM transfers. To do this, set one of the grid axes to the number of cores (can be obtained via `jax.devices()[0].num_cores`) and the dimension_semantics to `\"parallel\"`. Then, you can use `core_index = pl.program_id(axis)` to obtain the core index along that axis, and use `@pl.when(core_index==i)` to execute code specific to that core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction with XLA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we covered several kernel examples which replicate the functionality of collective operations in JAX such as `lax.all_gather`, `lax.psum`, and `lax.psum_scatter`. An important caveat to note is that a Pallas kernel is somewhat opaque to the XLA compiler and may cause it to miss some optimizations it would normally perform. For example, XLA can asynchronously dispatch collective operations in order to interleave communication and computation without writing a custom kernel. This is not guaranteed to happen when Pallas kernels are involved so it is important to profile your program to see if this is an issue. Another example is the fact that the `emit_pipeline` function we used in this tutorial to generate nested pipelines is not visible to the XLA compiler, and therefore cannot be fused with neighboring operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent follow-up exercises for the reader could include implementing a distributed matrix multiplication, implementing `lax.all_to_all`, and relaxing synchronization to allow for additional run-ahead."
