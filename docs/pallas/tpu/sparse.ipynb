Sparse computation is a major reason to write custom Pallas kernels over simply using JAX/XLA, since it is generally difficult to express programs that perform a dynamic amount of computation in XLA due to static array shapes. In this tutorial we will learn how to use the scalar prefetch feature of Pallas in order to write block-sparse kernels that can dynamically skip over computation and blocks of memory."

    "We will be exploiting the \"scalar prefetch\" feature of Pallas to enable us to write sparse kernels. Scalar prefetch allows you to pass in a small amount of data into SMEM (\"scalar memory\") that is loaded before the start of the pipeline (\"prefetch\"). Because this data is loaded before the pipeline, it is available for use in the `index_map` for each BlockSpec, allowing the you to perform data-dependent indexing calculations. The main goal of this tutorial is to go over common programming patterns that utilize this feature.\n",

The prefetch `Ref`s passed in to the `index_map` and kernel are all allocated in SMEM and are not partitioned into blocks as they do not have a BlockSpec defined. Moreover, the order of arguments to both `index_map` and kernel are always fixed and described below:\n",

During each inner loop iteration, we load one block from the LHS and lookup the corresponding block on in the RHS using the block index of the contracting dimension (K). We multiply the two blocks together and accumulate into the correct output block. One outer loop iteration will compute a result for an entire column as depicted by the following diagram:\n",

First, in our kernel we need to know when to initially zero-out the accumulator in the output ref, and it is easy to do so if the row indices are grouped. Second, the pipelining logic for Pallas does not allow us to re-visit blocks in the output `Ref` on non-consecutive iterations, and therefore we need to do all accumulation into an output block in consecutive kernel iterations. This is because the pipeline emitter will realize that we loading the same output block on consecutive iterations and keep the block in VMEM. When we change output block Pallas will finally store the output into HBM and assume we never touch it again. Failure to access output blocks consecutively will result in incorrect values even though the kernel is otherwise logically correct."

    "## Sparse Access Patterns on Dense Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example we considered the case when the data itself is sparse. This manifested itself in the kernel structure as a dimension in the kernel grid that was dynamic and looped over the number of nonzero blocks (`num_blocks`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second useful programming pattern emerges when the underlying is data is dense, but we wish to perform sparse computation over it. Our kernel grid in this case will be dense, but we wish to skip over some blocks in the grid as indicated by a block-sparse mask. This type of programming pattern is commonly arises when using masks in many machine learning applications, such as causal or local masks in self-attention. In these cases, we can entirely skip over computation in blocks where the mask is zeroed-out. Examples of this programming pattern can be found in the Splash Attention and Grouped Matrix Multiplication kernels located in `jax/experimental/pallas/ops/tpu`, or in PyTorch's [FlexAttention](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main performance consideration with dealing with a sparse access pattern on dense data is the interaction with pipelining. On any given kernel iteration, the Pallas pipeline emitter will attempt to prefetch the next block of data by calling the `index_map` for each `BlockSpec` on the next iteration of the grid. However, if our computation is sparse we may be skipping the computation for the next block in the grid, so we need some method to tell the pipeline instead begin fetching the *next block that we are not skipping*. In order to do this, we need to construct *prefetch maps* which contains indices to the next non-skipped block of data for each kernel input. The following diagram illustrates how a prefetch map could be constructed for a block-sparse mask that is stored in a COO-like format.\n",
    "\n",
    "![prefetch_map](../../_static/pallas/sparse/prefetch_map.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Left: A sparse access pattern, where the color blue denotes blocks with non-zero masks that we need to compute. Right: The prefetch map, where each element of the array contains the index of the next non-zero block data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the prefetch map has been constructed, we can pass the map as a scalar prefetch argument and query it in the `index_map` function of the BlockSpec.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mask_index_map(prefetch_map, i, j, ...):\n",
    "  next_nonzero_block = prefetch_map[i, j]\n",
    "  return (next_nonzero_block, 0, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct similar index maps for the other inputs to the kernel. For dense inputs you will most likely need to construct prefetch maps which point to the next non-zero block index in the grid. Our next example will provide an example of using these prefetch maps."
