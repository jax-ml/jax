    "### Block Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to implement `matmul(x, y)` which generically multiplies an `(m, k)` array with a `(k, n)` array, but with a twist. We're only allowed to use the primitive `matmul_small` which multiples small matrices (say `m, k, n <= 256`). How could we do it?\n",

    "Formally, if we have input arrays $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}$ and $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times n}$ and output $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, we decompose them into blocks along the dimensions of size $b_m, b_k, b_n$.\n",

    "## Matrix multiplication performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about how to analyze matrix multiplication performance. When we think about matmul performance, we typically care about two things: the total number of floating point operations (FLOPs) and the amount of memory bandwidth usage. From the [guide on TPUs and pipelining](pipelining), we see that in order to use the efficient compute units on TPUs (and on ML accelerators on general), we need to copy our inputs from HBM into VMEM, closer to the compute units. This copying to and from HBM takes time and an efficient kernel hopefully spends most of its time actually computing, as opposed to waiting for these transfers. Memory bandwidth measures the rate of this data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quick note: in this guide, we'll be discussing floating point operations, but want to make the distinction between FLOPs vs FLOP/s.\n",
    "  When we say \"FLOPs\" we mean \"floating point operations\", as in a number of operations. When we say \"FLOP/s\", we refer to \"floating point operations *per second*\", as in a *rate* of performing floating point operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of FLOPs in a `(m, k) x (k, n)` matrix multiplication are (approximately) `2 * m * k * n`. (Technically it is `n * m * (2k - 1)` but for large enough `k` our approximation is sufficient.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum amount of memory bandwidth usage for a matrix multiply (assuming float32) is the total size of the inputs (copying into VMEM) plus the size of the output (copying into HBM). Thus the minimum bandwidth usage is `(m * k + k * n + m * n) * 4 bytes/float32`. Memory usage can be greater if we re-read the inputs multiple times, which is often the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "One observation is that the number of matmul FLOPs is cubic in its inputs whereas the minimum bandwidth usage is quadratic in its inputs. Intuitively, this means that FLOPs grow faster than bandwidth usage, meaning that the bigger our matmul is, the more compute we have relative to copying."

    "## Performance of pipelined kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Our above analysis about FLOPs vs memory usage applies at a coarse scale i.e. when we are looking at the the size of a the total matrix multiplication. However, remember that in practice, we are pipelining the execution of a blocked matrix multiplication, meaning we have a loop in which we are doing matrix multiplication with smaller blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we actually care about the FLOPs vs memory bandwidth usage of each individual instance of the kernel, not the global FLOPs vs memory bandwidth usage. Therefore, the block sizes `bm`, `bk`, `bn` are extremely important for performance. Even if we have the largest matrices in the world, if we pick very small `bm`, `bk`, and `bn`, we will be memory bound because each time we invoke the kernel we will have too few FLOPs to hide the memory transfers happening in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition should therefore be: to be compute bound, make the blocks as big as possible! There are two main constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. VMEM usage: The bigger our blocks, the more VMEM we use. With large enough blocks, we will run out.\n",
    "2. Pipeline bubbles: The larger our blocks are relative to the matrix size, the fewer loop iterations we will have in our pipeline. This will make the size of the bubbles at the beginning and end of the pipeline larger relative to the total pipeline and this overhead can be nontrivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting good matrix multiplication performance in Pallas boils down to picking good block sizes to balance this optimization problem. In practice, we often sweep over a large set of candidate block sizes, profile the kernel, and pick the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's do some very simple timing experiments. We'll use `timeit` to measure the amount of time running each kernel takes. Note that this is a upper bound on the actual runtime of the kernel since we are measuring Python dispatch and other overheads using `timeit`. We'll compute the amount of FLOP/s we obtained this way and compute the percentage utilization we get compared to what the chip offers and we'll use some reasonable block sizes to verify our intuition."

    "In this guide, we covered how to write efficient matrix multiplications on TPU using Pallas. We discussed blocked matrix multiplication and pipelining, how to analyze the performance of a TPU matmul, and how to write an efficient `bf16` matrix multiplication. We concluded with templating the matrix multiplication to support a fused transpose and fused activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises left to the reader:\n",
    "* Add support for input fusions. Sometimes we want to fuse an operation into the inputs of the matmul. Try templating the matrix multiplication even more to support this.\n",
    "* Add support for `int8` matrix multiplication. TPU v5 supports native `int8` matrix multiplication at twice the FLOPs of `bf16`. Try adding support for that and see what utilization is possible.\n",
    "* Add backwards pass support for the `matmul` function. You can do this with `jax.custom_vjp`."
