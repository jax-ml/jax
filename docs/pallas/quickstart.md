# Pallas Quickstart

<!--* freshness: { reviewed: '2024-04-08' } *-->

Pallas is an extension to JAX that enables writing custom kernels for GPU and TPU.
Pallas allows you to use the same JAX functions and APIs but operates at a
*lower* level of abstraction.

Specifically, Pallas requires users to think about memory access and how to
divide up computations across multiple compute units in a hardware accelerator.
On GPUs, Pallas lowers to Triton and on TPUs, Pallas lowers to Mosaic.

Let's dive into some examples.

> Note: Pallas is still an experimental API and you may be broken by changes!

## Hello world in Pallas

```{code-cell} ipython3
from functools import partial

import jax
from jax.experimental import pallas as pl
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
```

We'll first write the "hello world" in Pallas, a kernel that adds two vectors.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def add_vectors_kernel(x_ref, y_ref, o_ref):
  x, y = x_ref[...], y_ref[...]
  o_ref[...] = x + y
```

**`Ref` types**

Let's dissect this function a bit. Unlike most JAX functions you've probably written,
it does not take in `jax.Array`s as inputs and doesn't return any values.
Instead, it takes in *`Ref`* objects as inputs, which represent mutable buffers in memory.
Note that we also don't have any outputs but we are given an `o_ref`, which corresponds
to the desired output.

**Reading from `Ref`s**

In the body, we are first reading from `x_ref` and `y_ref`, indicated by the `[...]`
(the ellipsis means we are reading the whole `Ref`;
alternatively we also could have used `x_ref[:]`).
Reading from a `Ref` like this returns a `jax.Array`.

**Writing to `Ref`s**

We then write `x + y` to `o_ref`.
Mutation has not historically been supported in JAX -- `jax.Array`s are immutable!
`Ref`s are new (experimental) types that allow mutation under certain circumstances.
We can interpret writing to a `Ref` as mutating its underlying buffer.

+++

So we've written what we call a "kernel", which we define as a program that will
run as an atomic unit of execution on an accelerator,
without any interaction with the host.
How do we invoke it from a JAX computation?
We use the `pallas_call` higher-order function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def add_vectors(x: jax.Array, y: jax.Array) -> jax.Array:
  return pl.pallas_call(
      add_vectors_kernel,
      out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct(x.shape, x.dtype)
  )(x, y)
add_vectors(jnp.arange(8), jnp.arange(8))
```

`pallas_call` lifts the Pallas kernel function into an operation that can be called
as part of a larger JAX program. But, to do so, it needs a few more details.
Here we specify `out_shape`, an object that has a `.shape` and `.dtype` (or a list
thereof).
`out_shape` determines the shape/dtype of `o_ref` in our `add_vector_kernel`.

`pallas_call` returns a function that takes in and returns `jax.Array`s.

+++

**What's actually happening here?**

Thus far we've described how to think about Pallas kernels but what we've actually
accomplished is we're writing a function that's executed very close to the compute units
since values are loaded into the innermost (fastest) portion of the memory hierarchy.

On GPU, `x_ref` corresponds to a value in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and when
we do `x_ref[...]` we are copying the value from HBM into static RAM (SRAM)
(this is a costly operation generally speaking!).
We then use GPU vector compute to execute the addition, then copy the resulting value
in SRAM back to HBM.

On TPU, we do something slightly different. Before the kernel is ever executed,
we fetch the value from HBM into SRAM. `x_ref` therefore corresponds to a value in
SRAM and when we do `x_ref[...]` we are copying the value from SRAM into a register.
We then use TPU vector compute to execute the addition, then copy the resulting
value back into SRAM. After the kernel is executed, the SRAM value is copied back into HBM.

We are in the process of writing backend-specific Pallas guides. Coming soon!

## Pallas programming model

+++

In our "hello world" example, we wrote a very simple kernel.
It takes advantage of the fact that our 8-sized arrays can comfortably fit inside
the SRAM of hardware accelerators.
In most real-world applications, this will not be the case!

+++

Part of writing Pallas kernels is thinking about how to take big arrays that
live in high-bandwidth memory (HBM, also known as DRAM) and expressing computations
that operate on "blocks" of those arrays that can fit in SRAM.

(grids_by_example)=

### Grids by example

To automatically "carve" up the inputs and outputs, you provide a `grid` and
`BlockSpec`s to `pallas_call`.

A `grid` is a tuple of integers (e.g. `()`, `(2, 3, 4)`, or `(8,)`) that specifies
an iteration space.
For example, a grid `(4, 5)` would have 20 elements:
`(0, 0), (0, 1), ..., (0, 4), (1, 0), ..., (3, 4)`.
We run the kernel function once for each element, a style of single-program
multiple-data (SPMD) programming.

<center>

A 2D grid
</center>

When we provide a `grid` to `pallas_call`, the kernel is executed as many times
as `prod(grid)`. Each of these invocations is referred to as a "program".
To access which program (i.e. which element of the grid) the kernel is currently
executing, we use `program_id(axis=...)`.
For example, for invocation `(1, 2)`, `program_id(axis=0)` returns `1` and
`program_id(axis=1)` returns `2`.

Here's an example kernel that uses a `grid` and `program_id`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def iota_kernel(o_ref):
  i = pl.program_id(0)
  o_ref[i] = i
```

We now execute it using `pallas_call` with an additional `grid` argument.
On GPUs, we can call the kernel directly like so:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# GPU version
def iota(size: int):
  return pl.pallas_call(iota_kernel,
                        out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((size,), jnp.int32),
                        grid=(size,))()
iota(8)
```

TPUs distinguish between vector and scalar memory spaces and in this case the
output must be placed in scalar memory (`MemorySpace.SMEM`) since `i` is
a scalar. For more details read {ref}`tpu_and_its_memory_spaces`.
To call the above kernel on TPU, run:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# TPU version
from jax.experimental.pallas import tpu as pltpu

def iota(size: int):
  return pl.pallas_call(iota_kernel,
                        out_specs=pl.BlockSpec(memory_space=pltpu.MemorySpace.SMEM),
                        out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((size,), jnp.int32),
                        grid=(size,))()
iota(8)
```

### Grid semantics

On GPUs, each program is executed in parallel on separate threads.
Thus, we need to think about race conditions on writes to HBM.
A reasonable approach is to write our kernels in such a way that different
programs write to disjoint locations in HBM to avoid these parallel writes.
On the other hand, parallelizing the computation is how we can execute
operations like matrix multiplications really quickly.

In contrast, TPUs operate like a very wide SIMD machine.
Some TPU models contain multiple cores, but in many cases a TPU can be
treated as a single-threaded processor. The grid on a TPU can be
specified in a combination of parallel and sequential dimensions, where sequential
dimensions are guaranteed to run serially.

You can read more details at {ref}`pallas_grid` and {ref}`pallas_tpu_noteworthy_properties`.

### Block specs by example

+++

With `grid` and `program_id` in mind, Pallas provides an abstraction that
takes care of some common indexing patterns seen in a lot of kernels.
To build intuition, let's try to implement a matrix multiplication.

A simple strategy for implementing a matrix multiplication in Pallas is to
implement it recursively.
We know our underlying hardware has support for small matrix multiplications
(using GPU and TPU tensorcores), so we just express a big matrix multiplication
in terms of smaller ones.

Suppose we have input matrices $X$ and $Y$ and are computing $Z = XY$.
We first express $X$ and $Y$ as block matrices. $X$ will have "row" blocks
and $Y$ will have "column" blocks.

$$
\begin{align*}
X = \begin{bmatrix}
X_0 \\ X_1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
Y_0 & Y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
Z &=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_0 \\ X_1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{matrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
Y_0 & Y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\\
~
\end{matrix}
\\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_0 Y_0 & X_0 Y_1 \\
X_1 Y_0 & X_1 Y_1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Our strategy is that because $Z$ is also a block matrix, we can assign each of
the programs in our Pallas kernel one of the output blocks.
Computing each output block corresponds to doing a smaller matrix multiply
between a "row" block of $X$ and a "column" block of $Y$.

+++

To express this pattern, we use `BlockSpec`s. A `BlockSpec` specifies a block
shape for each input and output, and an "index map" function, that maps a
set of program indices to a block index.

For a concrete example, let's say we'd like to multiply two `(1024, 1024)`
matrices `x` and `y` together to produce `z`, and would like to parallelize
the computation 4 ways. We split up `z` into 4 `(512, 512)` blocks where
each block is computed with a `(512, 1024) x (1024, 512)` matrix multiplication.
To express this, we'd first use a `(2, 2)` grid (one block for each program).

For `x`, we use `BlockSpec((512, 1024), lambda i, j: (i, 0))`  -- this
carves `x` up into "row" blocks.
To see this, see how both program instances
`(1, 0)` and `(1, 1)` pick the `(1, 0)` block in `x`.
For `y`, we use a transposed version `BlockSpec((1024, 512), lambda i, j: (0, j))`.
Finally, for `z` we use `BlockSpec((512, 512), lambda i, j: (i, j))`.

These `BlockSpec`s are passed into `pallas_call` via `in_specs` and `out_specs`.

For more detail on `BlockSpec`s see {ref}`pallas_blockspec`.

Underneath the hood, `pallas_call` will automatically carve up your inputs and
outputs into `Ref`s for each block that will be passed into the kernel.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def matmul_kernel(x_ref, y_ref, z_ref):
  z_ref[...] = x_ref[...] @ y_ref[...]

def matmul(x: jax.Array, y: jax.Array):
  return pl.pallas_call(
    matmul_kernel,
    out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((x.shape[0], y.shape[1]), x.dtype),
    grid=(2, 2),
    in_specs=[
        pl.BlockSpec((x.shape[0] // 2, x.shape[1]), lambda i, j: (i, 0)),
        pl.BlockSpec((y.shape[0], y.shape[1] // 2), lambda i, j: (0, j))
    ],
    out_specs=pl.BlockSpec(
        (x.shape[0] // 2, y.shape[1] // 2), lambda i, j: (i, j),
    )
  )(x, y)
k1, k2 = jax.random.split(jax.random.key(0))
x = jax.random.normal(k1, (1024, 1024))
y = jax.random.normal(k2, (1024, 1024))
z = matmul(x, y)
np.testing.assert_allclose(z, x @ y)
```

Note that this is a very naive implementation of a matrix multiplication but
consider it a starting point for various types of optimizations.
Let's add an additional feature to our matrix multiply: fused activation.
It's actually really easy! Just pass a higher-order activation function into the kernel.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def matmul_kernel(x_ref, y_ref, z_ref, *, activation):
  z_ref[...] = activation(x_ref[...] @ y_ref[...])

def matmul(x: jax.Array, y: jax.Array, *, activation):
  return pl.pallas_call(
    partial(matmul_kernel, activation=activation),
    out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((x.shape[0], y.shape[1]), x.dtype),
    grid=(2, 2),
    in_specs=[
        pl.BlockSpec((x.shape[0] // 2, x.shape[1]), lambda i, j: (i, 0)),
        pl.BlockSpec((y.shape[0], y.shape[1] // 2), lambda i, j: (0, j))
    ],
    out_specs=pl.BlockSpec(
        (x.shape[0] // 2, y.shape[1] // 2), lambda i, j: (i, j)
    ),
  )(x, y)
k1, k2 = jax.random.split(jax.random.key(0))
x = jax.random.normal(k1, (1024, 1024))
y = jax.random.normal(k2, (1024, 1024))
z = matmul(x, y, activation=jax.nn.relu)
np.testing.assert_allclose(z, jax.nn.relu(x @ y))
```

To conclude, let's highlight a cool feature of Pallas: it composes with `jax.vmap`!
To turn this matrix multiplication into a batched version, we just need to `vmap` it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
k1, k2 = jax.random.split(jax.random.key(0))
x = jax.random.normal(k1, (4, 1024, 1024))
y = jax.random.normal(k2, (4, 1024, 1024))
z = jax.vmap(partial(matmul, activation=jax.nn.relu))(x, y)
np.testing.assert_allclose(z, jax.nn.relu(jax.vmap(jnp.matmul)(x, y)))
```
