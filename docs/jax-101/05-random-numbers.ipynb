    "In this section we focus on pseudo random number generation (PRNG); that is, the process of algorithmically generating sequences of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers sampled from an appropriate distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "PRNG-generated sequences are not truly random because they are actually determined by their initial value, which is typically referred to as the `seed`, and each step of random sampling is a deterministic function of some `state` that is carried over from a sample to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo random number generation is an essential component of any machine learning or scientific computing framework. Generally, JAX strives to be compatible with NumPy, but pseudo random number generation is a notable exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the difference between the approaches taken by JAX and NumPy when it comes to random number generation we will discuss both approaches in this section."
