    "Isn't the pure version less efficient? Strictly, yes; we are creating a new array. However, as we will explain in the next guide, JAX computations are often compiled before being run using another program transformation, `jax.jit`. If we don't use the old array after modifying it 'in place' using indexed update operators, the compiler can recognise that it can in fact compile to an in-place modify, resulting in efficient code in the end.\n",

    "Of course, it's possible to mix side-effectful Python code and functionally pure JAX code, and we will touch on this more later. As you get more familiar with JAX, you will learn how and when this can work. As a rule of thumb, however, any functions intended to be transformed by JAX should avoid side-effects, and the JAX primitives themselves will try to help you do that.\n",

    "We will explain other places where the JAX idiosyncrasies become relevant as they come up. There is even a section that focuses entirely on getting used to the functional programming style of handling state: [Part 7: Problem of State](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax/blob/main/docs/jax-101/07-state.ipynb). However, if you're impatient, you can find a [summary of JAX's sharp edges](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html) in the JAX docs."

    "As you will see going through these guides, this basic recipe underlies almost all training loops you'll see implemented in JAX. The main difference between this example and real training loops is the simplicity of our model: that allows us to use a single array to house all our parameters. We cover managing more parameters in the later [pytree guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax/blob/main/docs/jax-101/05.1-pytrees.ipynb). Feel free to skip forward to that guide now to see how to manually define and train a simple MLP in JAX."
