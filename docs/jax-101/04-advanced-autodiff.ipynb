However, some features (like defining [custom derivatives](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Custom_derivative_rules_for_Python_code.html)) depend on understanding this, so it's worth knowing this explanation exists if you ever need to use them."

We fix this by adding `in_axes` to the `jax.vmap`, specifying theta as `None`, and the other args as `0`. This makes the resulting function add an extra axis only to the other arguments, leaving `theta` unbatched, as we want:"
