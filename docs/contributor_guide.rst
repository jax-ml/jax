Developer notes
===============

JAX welcomes contributions from the community.
These are guides to get set up as a developer, as well as
developer-focused resources, such as JAX Enhancement Proposals.

See also the :doc:`extension guides<../extensions>`, which document
some of JAX's (extensible) internals.
