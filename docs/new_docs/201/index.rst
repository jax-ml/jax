JAX 201: performance and scaling
================================

The :doc:`JAX 101 docs </new_docs/101/index>` covered how to *express*
computations: arrays and :mod:`jax.numpy`, transformations like
:func:`jax.grad` and :func:`jax.vmap`, pytrees, randomness, and state. None of
that made anything fast. These pages are about performance: compiling your
code, measuring it, scaling it from one chip to thousands, and tuning it.

**The core arc**, meant to be read in order, runs from compiling on one
device to programming many:

1. :doc:`jit` — how :func:`jax.jit` works and how to use it well: tracing
   and retracing, static arguments, caching, in-place updates with refs and
   buffer donation, and asynchronous dispatch.
2. :doc:`aot` — inspecting or controlling each stage of the ``jit`` pipeline.
3. :doc:`control-flow` — expressing conditionals and loops so they can be
   compiled: constraints on Python control flow under ``jit``, and the
   structured alternatives like ``lax.cond`` and ``lax.scan``.
4. :doc:`placement` — where arrays live: meshes as the unit of placement
   (single-device meshes included), committed vs. uncommitted arrays, and
   moving data between meshes.
5. :doc:`sharding` — the global-view programming model that scales one program
   to many devices, sharding as distributed data layout, plus device-local layout.
6. :doc:`shard-map` — the full tutorial for ``sharding``'s manual mode:
   per-device programming with explicit collectives, for complete control
   over how computation and communication are partitioned.
7. :doc:`callbacks` — calling back to host Python from compiled code with
   ``pure_callback`` and ``io_callback``, including how callbacks interact
   with sharded data.

**Diagnostics and tuning** pages are there for when you need them, in any
order:

8. :doc:`profiling` — how to measure: benchmarking pitfalls, capturing and
   reading profiler traces (including of distributed code), and device
   memory profiling.
9. :doc:`debugging` — printing and inspecting values inside compiled code,
   and the debugging flags every JAX user should know.
10. :doc:`slow-compilation` — diagnostic flags, reading the logs, and the
    Python patterns that defeat JAX's caches.
11. :doc:`precision` — dot algorithms, the classic ``Precision`` levels, and
    global defaults.
12. :doc:`controlling-xla` — XLA flags per function or process-wide, and
    attaching metadata to operations.
13. :doc:`gpu-memory` — how the allocator works, and what to do about
    out-of-memory failures.

A couple of performance topics — computation/communication overlap and
memory spaces — will be added here as those parts of JAX stabilize.
