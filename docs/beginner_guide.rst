Getting Started with JAX
========================
Welcome to JAX! The JAX documentation contains a number of useful resources for getting started.
:doc:`quickstart` is the easiest place to jump-in and get an overview of the JAX project.

If you're accustomed to writing NumPy code and are starting to explore JAX, you might find the following resources helpful:

- :doc:`notebooks/thinking_in_jax` is a conceptual walkthrough of JAX's execution model.
- :doc:`notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX` lists some of JAX's sharp corners.
- :doc:`faq` answers some frequent jax questions.

Tutorials

Building on JAX
---------------
JAX provides the core numerical computing primitives for a number of tools developed by the
larger community. For example, if you're interested in using JAX for training neural networks,
two well-supported options are Flax_ and Haiku_.

For a community-curated list of JAX-related projects across a wide set of domains,
check out `Awesome JAX`_.
