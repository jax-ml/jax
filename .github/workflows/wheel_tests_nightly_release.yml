# CI - Wheel Tests (Nightly/Release)
#
# This workflow builds JAX artifacts and runs CPU/CUDA tests.
#
# It orchestrates the following:
# 1. run-pytest-cpu:  Calls the `pytest_cpu.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib wheel that was
#                     built by internal CI jobs and runs CPU tests.
# 2. run-pytest-cuda: Calls the `pytest_cuda.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib and CUDA
#                     artifacts that were built by internal CI jobs and runs the CUDA tests.
