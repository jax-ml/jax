name: Nightly JAX CI on NVIDIA GPUs
# This configures running JAX tests (especially multi-node multi-gpu) against nightly GPU jaxlib builds.
# This is expected to fail frequently, and so we don't run it against every commit and PR in the repository.
# Portions of this adapted from https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/.github/workflows/upstream-nightly.yaml

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 12 * * *" # Daily at 12:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # allows triggering the workflow run manually
  pull_request:  # Automatically trigger on pull requests affecting this file
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '**workflows/nightly-ci-multiprocess-gpu.yml'
