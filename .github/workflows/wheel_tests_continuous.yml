# CI - Wheel Tests (Continuous)
#
# This workflow builds JAX artifacts and runs CPU/TPU/CUDA tests.
#
# It orchestrates the following:
# 1. build-jaxlib-artifact: Calls the `build_artifacts.yml` workflow to build jaxlib and
#                           uploads it to a GCS bucket.
# 2. run-pytest-cpu:        Calls the `pytest_cpu.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib wheel
#                           that was built in the previous step and runs CPU tests.
# 3. build-cuda-artifacts:  Calls the `build_artifacts.yml` workflow to build CUDA artifacts and
#                           uploads them to a GCS bucket.
# 4. run-bazel-test-cpu-py-import: Calls the `bazel_cpu_rbe.yml` workflow which
#                           runs Bazel CPU tests with py_import on RBE.
# 5. run-bazel-test-cuda-py-import: Calls the `bazel_cuda.yml` workflow which
#                           runs Bazel CUDA tests with py_import on non-RBE.
# 6. run-pytest-cuda:       Calls the `pytest_cuda.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib and CUDA
#                           artifacts that were built in the previous steps and runs the CUDA tests.
# 7. run-bazel-test-cuda:   Calls the `bazel_cuda.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib
#                           and CUDA artifacts that were built in the previous steps and runs the
#                           CUDA tests using Bazel.
# 8. run-pytest-tpu:        Calls the `pytest_tpu.yml` workflow which downloads the jaxlib wheel
#                           that was built in the previous step and runs TPU tests.
# 9. run-bazel-test-tpu:    Calls the `bazel_test_tpu.yml` workflow which
#                           runs Bazel TPU tests with py_import.
