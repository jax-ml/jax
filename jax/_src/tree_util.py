class Partial(functools.partial):
  """A version of functools.partial that works in pytrees.

  Use it for partial function evaluation in a way that is compatible with JAX's
  transformations, e.g., ``Partial(func, *args, **kwargs)``.

  (You need to explicitly opt-in to this behavior because we didn't want to give
  functools.partial different semantics than normal function closures.)

  For example, here is a basic usage of ``Partial`` in a manner similar to
  ``functools.partial``:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>> add_one = Partial(jnp.add, 1)
  >>> add_one(2)
  DeviceArray(3, dtype=int32)

  Pytree compatibility means that the resulting partial function can be passed
  as an argument within transformed JAX functions, which is not possible with a
  standard ``functools.partial`` function:

  >>> from jax import jit
  >>> @jit
  ... def call_func(f, *args):
  ...   return f(*args)
  ...
  >>> call_func(add_one, 2)
  DeviceArray(3, dtype=int32)

  Passing zero arguments to ``Partial`` effectively wraps the original function,
  making it a valid argument in JAX transformed functions:

  >>> call_func(Partial(jnp.add), 1, 2)
  DeviceArray(3, dtype=int32)

  Had we passed ``jnp.add`` to ``call_func`` directly, it would have resulted in a
  ``TypeError``.

  Note that if the result of ``Partial`` is used in the context where the
  value is traced, it results in all bound arguments being traced when passed
  to the partially-evaluated function:

  >>> print_zero = Partial(print, 0)
  >>> print_zero()
  0
  >>> call_func(print_zero)
  Traced<ShapedArray(int32[], weak_type=True)>with<DynamicJaxprTrace(level=0/1)>
