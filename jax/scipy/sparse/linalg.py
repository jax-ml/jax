def cg(A, b, x0=None, *, tol=1e-5, atol=0.0, maxiter=None, M=None):
  """Use Conjugate Gradient iteration to solve ``Ax = b``.

  The numerics of JAX's ``cg`` should exact match SciPy's ``cg`` (up to
  numerical precision), but note that the interface is slightly different: you
  need to supply the linear operator ``A`` as a function instead of a sparse
  matrix or ``LinearOperator``.

  Derivatives of ``cg`` are implemented via implicit differentiation with
  another ``cg`` solve, rather than by differentiating *through* the solver.
  They will be accurate only if both solves converge.

  Parameters
  ----------
  A : function
      Function that calculates the matrix-vector product ``Ax`` when called
      like ``A(x)``. ``A`` must represent a hermitian, positive definite
      matrix, and must return array(s) with the same structure and shape as its
      argument.
  b : array or tree of arrays
      Right hand side of the linear system representing a single vector. Can be
      stored as an array or Python container of array(s) with any shape.

  Returns
  -------
  x : array or tree of arrays
      The converged solution. Has the same structure as ``b``.
  info : None
      Placeholder for convergence information. In the future, JAX will report
      the number of iterations when convergence is not achieved, like SciPy.

  Other Parameters
  ----------------
  x0 : array
      Starting guess for the solution. Must have the same structure as ``b``.
  tol, atol : float, optional
      Tolerances for convergence, ``norm(residual) <= max(tol*norm(b), atol)``.
      We do not implement SciPy's "legacy" behavior, so JAX's tolerance will
      differ from SciPy unless you explicitly pass ``atol`` to SciPy's ``cg``.
  maxiter : integer
      Maximum number of iterations.  Iteration will stop after maxiter
      steps even if the specified tolerance has not been achieved.
  M : function
      Preconditioner for A.  The preconditioner should approximate the
      inverse of A.  Effective preconditioning dramatically improves the
      rate of convergence, which implies that fewer iterations are needed
      to reach a given error tolerance.
