"""Utilities for pseudo-random number generation.

The ``jax.random`` package provides a number of routines for deterministic
generation of sequences of pseudorandom numbers.

Basic usage
-----------

>>> seed = 1701
>>> num_steps = 100
>>> key = jax.random.PRNGKey(seed)
>>> for i in range(num_steps):
...   key, subkey = jax.random.split(key)
...   params = compiled_update(subkey, params, next(batches))  # doctest: +SKIP

PRNG Keys
---------

Unlike the *stateful* pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that users of NumPy and
SciPy may be accustomed to, JAX random functions all require an explicit PRNG state to
be passed as a first argument.
The random state is described by two unsigned 32-bit integers that we call a **key**,
usually generated by the :py:func:`jax.random.PRNGKey` function::

    >>> from jax import random
    >>> key = random.PRNGKey(0)
    >>> key
    DeviceArray([0, 0], dtype=uint32)

This key can then be used in any of JAX's random number generation routines::

    >>> random.uniform(key)
    DeviceArray(0.41845703, dtype=float32)

Note that using a key does not modify it, so reusing the same key will lead to the same result::

    >>> random.uniform(key)
    DeviceArray(0.41845703, dtype=float32)

If you need a new random number, you can use :meth:`jax.random.split` to generate new subkeys::

    >>> key, subkey = random.split(key)
    >>> random.uniform(subkey)
    DeviceArray(0.10536897, dtype=float32)

Design and Context
==================

**TLDR**: JAX PRNG = `Threefry counter PRNG <http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf>`_
+ a functional array-oriented `splitting model <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2503784>`_

See `docs/design_notes/prng.md <https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/docs/design_notes/prng.md>`_
for more details.

To summarize, among other requirements, the JAX PRNG aims to:

1.  ensure reproducibility,
2.  parallelize well, both in terms of vectorization (generating array values)
    and multi-replica, multi-core computation. In particular it should not use
    sequencing constraints between random function calls.

Advanced RNG configuration
==========================

JAX provides several PRNG implementations (controlled by the
`jax_default_prng_impl` flag).

-   **default**
    `A counter-based PRNG built around the Threefry hash function <http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf>`_.
-   *experimental* A PRNG that thinly wraps the XLA Random Bit Generator (RBG) algorithm. See
    `TF doc <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics#rngbitgenerator>`_.

    -   "rbg" uses ThreeFry for splitting, and XLA RBG for data generation.
    -   "unsafe_rbg" exists only for demonstration purposes, using RBG both for
        splitting (using an untested made up algorithm) and generating.

    The random streams generated by these experimental implementations haven't
    been subject to any empirical randomness testing (e.g. Big Crush). The
    random bits generated may change between JAX versions.

The possible reasons not use the default RNG are:

1.  it may be slow to compile (specifically for Google Cloud TPUs)
2.  it's slower to execute on TPUs

Here is a short summary:

.. table::
   :widths: auto

   =================================   =================  ===  ==========
   Property                            ThreeFry, default  rbg  unsafe_rbg
   =================================   =================  ===  ==========
   Fast on TPU                                             ✅   ✅
   always correct w/ scan               ✅                 ✅
   always correct w/ remat              ✅                 ✅
   identical across CPU/GPU/TPU         ✅                 ✅
   identical across JAX/XLA versions    ✅
   identical across shardings           ✅                 ✅   ✅
   =================================   =================  ===  ==========

NOTE: RNGs are currently identical across shardings because the random value
is first materialized replicated on each device and then the slice that each
device needs is later sliced out.
