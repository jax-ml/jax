    "Software pipelining is an important technique in performance optimization by overlapping multiple asynchronous operations even if there are data dependencies between them. In the context of kernel writing, the most common form of pipelining involves overlapping communication and memory transfers with compute such that the hardware accelerator never stalls while waiting for data to arrive. Therefore, we will solely focus on the problem of communication-compute pipelining in this tutorial. We will begin by covering the problem conceptually, outlining the Pallas API for writing pipelines, and going over some realistic examples using the API.\n",

    "The first step in understanding pipelining conceptually involves understanding the different forms of memory available and the tradeoffs between them. Most hardware architectures (including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs) utilize a wide variety of memory spaces that tradeoff capicity vs latency/bandwidth. For the purpose of Pallas, we are typically interested in registers, SRAM, DRAM, and potentially network communication:\n",
    "- **Registers** are the the memory physically closest to the processor, and typically values must be loaded directly into registers before doing any compute on them.\n",
    "- **SRAM** (also known as Shared Memory/L1 and L2 cache on GPUs, or VMEM on TPUs) also lives fairly close to the processor, but has larger capacity than registers.\n",
    "SRAM on modern ML accelerators typically range in the 10-100MB range (TPU v5p contains 96MB of VMEM, and H100 GPUs contain ~30MB of L1 cache and 50MB of L2).\n",
    "It's reasonable to expect the latency to access SRAM to be on the order of 10x longer than accessing a register.\n",
    "- **DRAM** (also known as HBM) has much higher capacity than SRAM, typically in the 10-100GB range for modern ML accelerators. However, the latency is roughly on the order of 10x longer to access compared to SRAM.\n",
    "- **Network** communication becomes crucial for larger workloads when the size of DRAM on a single device becomes insufficient or when we'd like to take advantage of parallel computations. We do not cover distributed pipelining in this tutorial, but see the [distributed TPU kernels](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/distributed.html) guide for writing pipelines across multiple devices.\n",

Pipelining is a very general programming pattern which will allow us to do exactly this, but it requires transforming your problem into smaller sub-problems that can be overlapped in parallel.\n",

    "The diagram above depicts how an idealized pipelined program can be scheduled across time. The key insight is that in the majority of the kernel, the copy operations are executed in parallel with compute operations, meaning we can ideally \"hide\" the cost of transferring between HBM/SRAM with computation and keep the processor busy with as much uptime as possible.\n",

    "The initial startup time and final teardown time known as \"bubbles\", where only a subset of the stages are being executed while the pipeline is being \"filled\" or \"drained\". The bulk of the time is spent in the \"steady-state\" phase of the pipeline, where each pipeline stage is being executed in parallel across different iterations of the subproblem. While with more general pipelining approaches the goal is to achieve N-way parallelism (where N is the number of stages), with kernel pipelining we are usually bottlenecked either by memory bandwidth or processing speed. Therefore, our goal with kernel pipelining is typically to achieve full utilization of the FLOPs/s of our processor, meaning that at any point in time there is always a `compute` block active. In the figure above, the compute block is active in 6/8 timeslots, and assuming we are fully utilizing the processor in each compute timeslot, we would have achieved 75% utilization of the processor."

    "While pipelining provides a close approximation to the mental model of simply calling a kernel function in a loop, there are a number of sharp edges that arise from the use of intermediate buffers that are not fully hidden from the user and can result in subtle bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffer Revisiting\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a good rule-of-thumb to follow is that **the input buffers passed into the kernel function should be interpreted as read-only, and output buffers are write only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing to inputs and reading from outputs will in most cases result in incorrectness. This is because the SRAM buffers passed to a kernel only contain copies of the data contained in the underlying HBM buffer. If an input SRAM buffer is updated, the updated results will never be written back out to HBM, and if an output buffer is updated, it's updated value is never read into SRAM. This issue is analogous to staleness issues encountered when using caches in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cases where a buffer supports both reads and writes - accumulation (discussed next), and marking a pair of input and output buffers as input-output aliased by passing in the `input_output_aliases` argument to `pallas_call`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reductions and accumulation\n",

    "\n",
    "Reductions are one of the few cases where the pipeline supports both reading and writing to an output buffer, but the reason it works is subtle.\n",
    "The Pallas pipeline emitter performs an optimization where if the data slices between two consecutive iterations are the same, the pipeline will not issue a `copy_in`/`copy_out` on that buffer. This means the same SRAM buffer used in a previous iteration will be passed into the kernel again on the following iteration, and thus any writes that were issued to the output buffer will become visible on the next iteration. Once the data slice changes, the final accumulated SRAM buffer will be written out to HBM. This is also why reductions must be performed over the last dimensions of the grid -- we want to finish all of the accumulation while the output buffer is in SRAM in the innermost loop, then write it to HBM and never touch that output block again.\n",

Generally, our goal is to optimize a kernel such that it is compute-bound, meaning we are utilizing all of the available processing power of our hardware.\n",

The ratio of $X$ to $Y$ varies depending on the type of compute -- for elementwise operations such as addition or multiplication, they will both scale equally. However, for operations such as matrix multiplication, compute scales cubically with the size of the problem while memory scales quadratically.\n",
