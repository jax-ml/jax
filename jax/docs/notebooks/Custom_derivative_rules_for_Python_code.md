# Custom derivative rules

<!--* freshness: { reviewed: '2024-04-08' } *-->

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Custom_derivative_rules_for_Python_code.ipynb) [![Open in Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Custom_derivative_rules_for_Python_code.ipynb)

There are two ways to define differentiation rules in JAX:

1. using `jax.custom_jvp` and `jax.custom_vjp` to define custom differentiation rules for Python functions that are already JAX-transformable; and
2. defining new `core.Primitive` instances along with all their transformation rules, for example to call into functions from other systems like solvers, simulators, or general numerical computing systems.

This notebook is about #1. To read instead about #2, see the [notebook on adding primitives](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html).

For an introduction to JAX's automatic differentiation API, see [The Autodiff Cookbook](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html). This notebook assumes some familiarity with [jax.jvp](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#jax.jvp) and [jax.grad](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#jax.grad), and the mathematical meaning of JVPs and VJPs.

## Example problems

To get an idea of what problems `jax.custom_jvp` and `jax.custom_vjp` are meant to solve, let's go over a few examples. A more thorough introduction to the `jax.custom_jvp` and `jax.custom_vjp` APIs is in the next section.

+++ {"id": "AR02eyd1GQhC"}

### Numerical stability

One application of `jax.custom_jvp` is to improve the numerical stability of differentiation.

+++ {"id": "GksPXslaGPaW"}

Say we want to write a function called `log1pexp`, which computes $x \mapsto \log ( 1 + e^x )$. We can write that using `jax.numpy`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 6lWbTvs40ET-
:outputId: 8caff99e-add1-4c70-ace3-212c0c5c6f4e


def log1pexp(x):
  return jnp.log(1. + jnp.exp(x))

log1pexp(3.)
```

+++ {"id": "PL36r_cD0oE8"}

Since it's written in terms of `jax.numpy`, it's JAX-transformable:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: XgtGKFld02UD
:outputId: 809d399d-8eca-401e-b969-810e46648571

from jax import jit, grad, vmap

print(jit(log1pexp)(3.))
print(jit(grad(log1pexp))(3.))
print(vmap(jit(grad(log1pexp)))(jnp.arange(3.)))
```

+++ {"id": "o56Nr3V61PKS"}

But there's a numerical stability problem lurking here:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: sVM6iwIO22sB
:outputId: 9c935ee8-f174-475a-ca01-fc80949199e5

print(grad(log1pexp)(100.))
```

+++ {"id": "Zu9sR2I73wuO"}

That doesn't seem right! After all, the derivative of $x \mapsto \log (1 + e^x)$ is $x \mapsto \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}$, and so for large values of $x$ we'd expect the value to be about 1.

We can get a bit more insight into what's going on by looking at the jaxpr for the gradient computation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: dO6uZlYR4TVp
:outputId: 61e06b1e-14cd-4030-f330-a949be185df8

from jax import make_jaxpr

make_jaxpr(grad(log1pexp))(100.)
```

+++ {"id": "52HR5EW26PEt"}

Stepping through how the jaxpr would be evaluated, we can see that the last line would involve multiplying values that floating point math will round to 0 and $\infty$, respectively, which is never a good idea. That is, we're effectively evaluating `lambda x: (1 / (1 + jnp.exp(x))) * jnp.exp(x)` for large `x`, which effectively turns into `0. * jnp.inf`.

Instead of generating such large and small values, hoping for a cancellation that floats can't always provide, we'd rather just express the derivative function as a more numerically stable program. In particular, we can write a program that more closely evaluates the equal mathematical expression $1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^x}$, with no cancellation in sight.

This problem is interesting because even though our definition of `log1pexp` could already be JAX-differentiated (and transformed with `jit`, `vmap`, ...), we're not happy with the result of applying standard autodiff rules to the primitives comprising `log1pexp` and composing the result. Instead, we'd like to specify how the whole function `log1pexp` should be differentiated, as a unit, and thus arrange those exponentials better.

This is one application of custom derivative rules for Python functions that are already JAX transformable: specifying how a composite function should be differentiated, while still using its original Python definition for other transformations (like `jit`, `vmap`, ...).

Here's a solution using `jax.custom_jvp`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: XQt6MAuTJewG

from jax import custom_jvp

@custom_jvp
def log1pexp(x):
  return jnp.log(1. + jnp.exp(x))

@log1pexp.defjvp
def log1pexp_jvp(primals, tangents):
  x, = primals
  x_dot, = tangents
  ans = log1pexp(x)
  ans_dot = (1 - 1/(1 + jnp.exp(x))) * x_dot
  return ans, ans_dot
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: rhiMHulfKBIF
:outputId: 883bc4d2-3a1b-48d3-b205-c500f77d229c

print(grad(log1pexp)(100.))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 9cLDuAo6KGUu
:outputId: 59984494-6124-4540-84fd-608ad4fc6bc6

print(jit(log1pexp)(3.))
print(jit(grad(log1pexp))(3.))
print(vmap(jit(grad(log1pexp)))(jnp.arange(3.)))
```

+++ {"id": "9sVUGbGkUOqO"}

Here's a `defjvps` convenience wrapper to express the same thing:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: xfQTp8F7USEM

@custom_jvp
def log1pexp(x):
  return jnp.log(1. + jnp.exp(x))

log1pexp.defjvps(lambda t, ans, x: (1 - 1/(1 + jnp.exp(x))) * t)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

print(jit(grad(log1pexp))(3.))
print(vmap(jit(grad(log1pexp)))(jnp.arange(3.)))
```

+++ {"id": "V9tHAfrSF1N-"}

### Enforcing a differentiation convention

A related application is to enforce a differentiation convention, perhaps at a boundary.

+++ {"id": "l_6tdb-QGK-H"}

Consider the function $f : \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+$ with $f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{x}}$, where we take $\mathbb{R}_+ = [0, \infty)$. We might implement $f$ as a program like this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: AfF5P7x_GaSe

def f(x):
  return x / (1 + jnp.sqrt(x))
```

+++ {"id": "BVcEkF3ZGgv1"}

As a mathematical function on $\mathbb{R}$ (the full real line), $f$ is not differentiable at zero (because the limit defining the derivative doesn't exist from the left). Correspondingly, autodiff produces a `nan` value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: piI0u5MiHhQh
:outputId: c045308f-2f3b-4c22-ebb2-b9ee582b4d25

print(grad(f)(0.))
```

+++ {"id": "IP0H2b7ZHkzD"}

But mathematically if we think of $f$ as a function on $\mathbb{R}_+$ then it is differentiable at 0 [Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis Definition 5.1, or Tao's Analysis I 3rd ed. Definition 10.1.1 and Example 10.1.6]. Alternatively, we might say as a convention we want to consider the directional derivative from the right. So there is a sensible value for the Python function `grad(f)` to return at `0.0`, namely `1.0`. By default, JAX's machinery for differentiation assumes all functions are defined over $\mathbb{R}$ and thus doesn't produce `1.0` here.

We can use a custom JVP rule! In particular, we can define the JVP rule in terms of the derivative function $x \mapsto \frac{\sqrt{x} + 2}{2(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2}$ on $\mathbb{R}_+$,

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: ksHmCkcSKQJr

@custom_jvp
def f(x):
  return x / (1 + jnp.sqrt(x))

@f.defjvp
def f_jvp(primals, tangents):
  x, = primals
  x_dot, = tangents
  ans = f(x)
  ans_dot = ((jnp.sqrt(x) + 2) / (2 * (jnp.sqrt(x) + 1)**2)) * x_dot
  return ans, ans_dot
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: Gsh9ZvMTKi1O
:outputId: a3076175-6542-4210-ce4a-d0d82e0051c6

print(grad(f)(0.))
```

+++ {"id": "Usbp_gxaVVea"}

Here's the convenience wrapper version:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: qXnrxIfaVYCs

@custom_jvp
def f(x):
  return x / (1 + jnp.sqrt(x))

f.defjvps(lambda t, ans, x: ((jnp.sqrt(x) + 2) / (2 * (jnp.sqrt(x) + 1)**2)) * t)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: uUU5qRmEViK1
:outputId: ea7dc2c4-a100-48f4-a74a-859070daf994

print(grad(f)(0.))
```

+++ {"id": "7J2A85wbSAmF"}

### Gradient clipping

While in some cases we want to express a mathematical differentiation computation, in other cases we may even want to take a step away from mathematics to adjust the computation autodiff performs. One canonical example is reverse-mode gradient clipping.

For gradient clipping, we can use `jnp.clip` together with a `jax.custom_vjp` reverse-mode-only rule:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 8jfjSanIW_tJ

from functools import partial
from jax import custom_vjp

@custom_vjp
def clip_gradient(lo, hi, x):
  return x  # identity function

def clip_gradient_fwd(lo, hi, x):
  return x, (lo, hi)  # save bounds as residuals

def clip_gradient_bwd(res, g):
  lo, hi = res
  return (None, None, jnp.clip(g, lo, hi))  # use None to indicate zero cotangents for lo and hi

clip_gradient.defvjp(clip_gradient_fwd, clip_gradient_bwd)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 4OLU_vf8Xw2J
:outputId: 5a51ff2c-79c2-41ba-eead-53679b4eddbc

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from jax import vmap

t = jnp.linspace(0, 10, 1000)

plt.plot(jnp.sin(t))
plt.plot(vmap(grad(jnp.sin))(t))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: iS8nRuBZYLcD
:outputId: 299dc977-ff2f-43a4-c0d2-9fa6c7eaeeb2

def clip_sin(x):
  x = clip_gradient(-0.75, 0.75, x)
  return jnp.sin(x)

plt.plot(clip_sin(t))
plt.plot(vmap(grad(clip_sin))(t))
```

### Python debugging

Another application that is motivated by development workflow rather than numerics is to set a `pdb` debugger trace in the backward pass of reverse-mode autodiff.

+++ {"id": "cgxMjNTrGjJn"}

When trying to track down the source of a `nan` runtime error, or just examine carefully the cotangent (gradient) values being propagated, it can be useful to insert a debugger at a point in the backward pass that corresponds to a specific point in the primal computation. You can do that with `jax.custom_vjp`.

We'll defer an example until the next section.

+++ {"id": "IC7tEcr1-Fc5"}

### Implicit function differentiation of iterative implementations

This example gets pretty deep in the mathematical weeds!

+++ {"id": "szAt97t80hew"}

Another application for `jax.custom_vjp` is reverse-mode differentiation of functions that are JAX-transformable (by `jit`, `vmap`, ...) but not efficiently JAX-differentiable for some reason, perhaps because they involve `lax.while_loop`. (It's not possible to produce an XLA HLO program that efficiently computes the reverse-mode derivative of an XLA HLO While loop because that would require a program with unbounded memory use, which isn't possible to express in XLA HLO, at least without side-effecting interactions through infeed/outfeed.)

For example, consider this `fixed_point` routine which computes a fixed point by iteratively applying a function in a `while_loop`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 2uA8X2izXH2b

from jax.lax import while_loop

def fixed_point(f, a, x_guess):
  def cond_fun(carry):
    x_prev, x = carry
    return jnp.abs(x_prev - x) > 1e-6

  def body_fun(carry):
    _, x = carry
    return x, f(a, x)

  _, x_star = while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun, (x_guess, f(a, x_guess)))
  return x_star
```

+++ {"id": "p2xFQAte19sF"}

This is an iterative procedure for numerically solving the equation $x = f(a, x)$ for $x$, by iterating $x_{t+1} = f(a, x_t)$ until $x_{t+1}$ is sufficiently close to $x_t$. The result $x^*$ depends on the parameters $a$, and so we can think of there being a function $a \mapsto x^*(a)$ that is implicitly defined by equation $x = f(a, x)$.

We can use `fixed_point` to run iterative procedures to convergence, for example running Newton's method to calculate square roots while only executing adds, multiplies, and divides:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: rDDwM8bYYzRT

def newton_sqrt(a):
  update = lambda a, x: 0.5 * (x + a / x)
  return fixed_point(update, a, a)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 42Ydd7_6aLXU
:outputId: c576dc92-33df-42b9-b2e8-ad54119514b1

print(newton_sqrt(2.))
```

+++ {"id": "-yFtYWH13QWm"}

We can `vmap` or `jit` the function as well:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: t_YSXieT3Yyk
:outputId: 76483e18-81f3-47a8-e8aa-e81535c01fe2

print(jit(vmap(newton_sqrt))(jnp.array([1., 2., 3., 4.])))
```

+++ {"id": "emwWIt3d3h1T"}

We can't apply reverse-mode automatic differentiation because of the `while_loop`, but it turns out we wouldn't want to anyway: instead of differentiating through the implementation of `fixed_point` and all its iterations, we can exploit the mathematical structure to do something that is much more memory-efficient (and FLOP-efficient in this case, too!). We can instead use the implicit function theorem [Prop A.25 of Bertsekas's Nonlinear Programming, 2nd ed.], which guarantees (under some conditions) the existence of the mathematical objects we're about to use. In essence, we linearize at the solution and solve those linear equations iteratively to compute the derivatives we want.

Consider again the equation $x = f(a, x)$ and the function $x^*$. We want to evaluate vector-Jacobian products like $v^\mathsf{T} \mapsto v^\mathsf{T} \partial x^*(a_0)$.

At least in an open neighborhood around the point $a_0$ at which we want to differentiate, let's assume that the equation $x^*(a) = f(a, x^*(a))$ holds for all $a$. Since the two sides are equal as functions of $a$, their derivatives must be equal as well, so let's differentiate both sides:

$\qquad \partial x^*(a) = \partial_0 f(a, x^*(a)) + \partial_1 f(a, x^*(a))  \partial x^*(a)$.

Setting $A = \partial_1 f(a_0, x^*(a_0))$ and $B = \partial_0 f(a_0, x^*(a_0))$, we can write the quantity we're after more simply as

$\qquad \partial x^*(a_0) = B + A \partial x^*(a_0)$,

or, by rearranging,

$\qquad \partial x^*(a_0) = (I - A)^{-1} B$.

That means we can evaluate vector-Jacobian products like

$\qquad v^\mathsf{T} \partial x^*(a_0) = v^\mathsf{T} (I - A)^{-1} B = w^\mathsf{T} B$,

where $w^\mathsf{T} = v^\mathsf{T} (I - A)^{-1}$, or equivalently $w^\mathsf{T} = v^\mathsf{T} + w^\mathsf{T} A$, or equivalently $w^\mathsf{T}$ is the fixed point of the map $u^\mathsf{T} \mapsto v^\mathsf{T} + u^\mathsf{T} A$. That last characterization gives us a way to write the VJP for `fixed_point` in terms of a call to `fixed_point`! Moreover, after expanding $A$ and $B$ back out, we can see we need only to evaluate VJPs of $f$ at $(a_0, x^*(a_0))$.

Here's the upshot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: g4jo-xlvdiym

from jax import vjp

@partial(custom_vjp, nondiff_argnums=(0,))
def fixed_point(f, a, x_guess):
  def cond_fun(carry):
    x_prev, x = carry
    return jnp.abs(x_prev - x) > 1e-6

  def body_fun(carry):
    _, x = carry
    return x, f(a, x)

  _, x_star = while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun, (x_guess, f(a, x_guess)))
  return x_star

def fixed_point_fwd(f, a, x_init):
  x_star = fixed_point(f, a, x_init)
  return x_star, (a, x_star)

def fixed_point_rev(f, res, x_star_bar):
  a, x_star = res
  _, vjp_a = vjp(lambda a: f(a, x_star), a)
  a_bar, = vjp_a(fixed_point(partial(rev_iter, f),
                             (a, x_star, x_star_bar),
                             x_star_bar))
  return a_bar, jnp.zeros_like(x_star)

def rev_iter(f, packed, u):
  a, x_star, x_star_bar = packed
  _, vjp_x = vjp(lambda x: f(a, x), x_star)
  return x_star_bar + vjp_x(u)[0]

fixed_point.defvjp(fixed_point_fwd, fixed_point_rev)
```

```

+++ {"id": "DvVmlaPD7W-4"}

We can check our answers by differentiating `jnp.sqrt`, which uses a totally different implementation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: jj_JnI9Pm4jg
:outputId: 6eb3e158-209b-41f2-865c-376a1d07624b

print(grad(jnp.sqrt)(2.))
print(grad(grad(jnp.sqrt))(2.))
```

+++ {"id": "HowvqayEuy-H"}

A limitation to this approach is that the argument `f` can't close over any values involved in differentiation. That is, you might notice that we kept the parameter `a` explicit in the argument list of `fixed_point`. For this use case, consider using the low-level primitive `lax.custom_root`, which allows for deriviatives in closed-over variables with custom root-finding functions.

## Basic usage of `jax.custom_jvp` and `jax.custom_vjp` APIs

+++ {"id": "MojTOg4tmQNT"}

### Use `jax.custom_jvp` to define forward-mode (and, indirectly, reverse-mode) rules

Here's a canonical basic example of using `jax.custom_jvp`, where the comments use
[Haskell-like type signatures](https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_signature):

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: nVkhbIFAOGZk

from jax import custom_jvp
import jax.numpy as jnp

# f :: a -> b
@custom_jvp
def f(x):
  return jnp.sin(x)

# f_jvp :: (a, T a) -> (b, T b)
def f_jvp(primals, tangents):
  x, = primals
  t, = tangents
  return f(x), jnp.cos(x) * t

f.defjvp(f_jvp)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: fxhlECvW7Krj
:outputId: 30dc5e8b-d157-4ae2-cd17-145d4e1ba47b

from jax import jvp

print(f(3.))

y, y_dot = jvp(f, (3.,), (1.,))
print(y)
print(y_dot)
```

+++ {"id": "JaoQVRzSQ9Qd"}

In words, we start with a primal function `f` that takes inputs of type `a` and produces outputs of type `b`. We associate with it a JVP rule function `f_jvp` that takes a pair of inputs representing the primal inputs of type `a` and the corresponding tangent inputs of type `T a`, and produces a pair of outputs representing the primal outputs of type `b` and tangent outputs of type `T b`. The tangent outputs should be a linear function of the tangent inputs.

+++ {"id": "1xGky7yMOavq"}

You can also use `f.defjvp` as a decorator, as in

```python
@custom_jvp
def f(x):
  ...

@f.defjvp
def f_jvp(primals, tangents):
  ...
```

+++ {"id": "e9R-ppvdQIOC"}

Even though we defined only a JVP rule and no VJP rule, we can use both forward- and reverse-mode differentiation on `f`. JAX will automatically transpose the linear computation on tangent values from our custom JVP rule, computing the VJP as efficiently as if we had written the rule by hand:

The `defjvps` convenience wrapper lets us define a JVP for each argument separately, and the results are computed separately then summed:

Notice that `f_jvp` calls `f` to compute the primal outputs. In the context of higher-order differentiation, each application of a differentiation transform will use the custom JVP rule if and only if the rule calls the original `f` to compute the primal outputs. (This represents a kind of fundamental tradeoff, where we can't make use of intermediate values from the evaluation of `f` in our rule _and also_ have the rule apply in all orders of higher-order differentiation.)

### Use `jax.custom_vjp` to define custom reverse-mode-only rules

While `jax.custom_jvp` suffices for controlling both forward- and, via JAX's automatic transposition, reverse-mode differentiation behavior, in some cases we may want to directly control a VJP rule, for example in the latter two example problems presented above. We can do that with `jax.custom_vjp`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: zAZk1n3dUw76

from jax import custom_vjp
import jax.numpy as jnp

# f :: a -> b
@custom_vjp
def f(x):
  return jnp.sin(x)

# f_fwd :: a -> (b, c)
def f_fwd(x):
  return f(x), jnp.cos(x)

# f_bwd :: (c, CT b) -> CT a
def f_bwd(cos_x, y_bar):
  return (cos_x * y_bar,)

f.defvjp(f_fwd, f_bwd)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: E8W-H2S0Ngdr
:outputId: cd0dc221-e779-436d-f3b4-21e799f40620

from jax import grad

print(f(3.))
print(grad(f)(3.))
```

+++ {"id": "yLING7qEVGGN"}

In words, we again start with a primal function `f` that takes inputs of type `a` and produces outputs of type `b`. We associate with it two functions, `f_fwd` and `f_bwd`, which describe how to perform the forward- and backward-passes of reverse-mode autodiff, respectively.

The function `f_fwd` describes the forward pass, not only the primal computation but also what values to save for use on the backward pass. Its input signature is just like that of the primal function `f`, in that it takes a primal input of type `a`. But as output it produces a pair, where the first element is the primal output `b` and the second element is any "residual" data of type `c` to be stored for use by the backward pass. (This second output is analogous to [PyTorch's save_for_backward mechanism](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_autograd/two_layer_net_custom_function.html).)

The function `f_bwd` describes the backward pass. It takes two inputs, where the first is the residual data of type `c` produced by `f_fwd` and the second is the output cotangents of type `CT b` corresponding to the output of the primal function. It produces an output of type `CT a` representing the cotangents corresponding to the input of the primal function. In particular, the output of `f_bwd` must be a sequence (e.g. a tuple) of length equal to the number of arguments to the primal function.

So multiple arguments work like this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: IhMb64gkngAt

def f(x, y):
  return jnp.sin(x) * y

def f_fwd(x, y):
  return f(x, y), (jnp.cos(x), jnp.sin(x), y)

def f_bwd(res, g):
  cos_x, sin_x, y = res
  return (cos_x * g * y, sin_x * g)

f.defvjp(f_fwd, f_bwd)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: EnRtIhhLnkry

### Working with `list` / `tuple` / `dict` containers (and other pytrees)

You should expect standard Python containers like lists, tuples, namedtuples, and dicts to just work, along with nested versions of those. In general, any [pytrees](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pytrees.html) are permissible, so long as their structures are consistent according to the type constraints. 

Here's a contrived example with `jax.custom_jvp`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: 6sDLZ3dAn3P2

from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])

@custom_jvp
def f(pt):
  x, y = pt.x, pt.y
  return {'a': x ** 2,
          'b': (jnp.sin(x), jnp.cos(y))}

@f.defjvp
def f_jvp(primals, tangents):
  pt, = primals
  pt_dot, =  tangents
  ans = f(pt)
  ans_dot = {'a': 2 * pt.x * pt_dot.x,
             'b': (jnp.cos(pt.x) * pt_dot.x, -jnp.sin(pt.y) * pt_dot.y)}
  return ans, ans_dot

def fun(pt):
  dct = f(pt)
  return dct['a'] + dct['b'][0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:id: My8pbOlPppJj
:outputId: 04cc1129-d0fb-4018-bec1-2ccf8b7906e3

+++ {"id": "BTEnNTk5D0sM"}

See `fixed_point` above for another usage example.

**You don't need to use** `nondiff_argnums` **with array-valued arguments**, for example ones with integer dtype. Instead, `nondiff_argnums` should only be used for argument values that don't correspond to JAX types (essentially don't correspond to array types), like Python callables or strings. If JAX detects that an argument indicated by `nondiff_argnums` contains a JAX Tracer, then an error is raised. The `clip_gradient` function above is a good example of not using `nondiff_argnums` for integer-dtype array arguments.
