    Suppose we have

      $ cat your/thing/prog.py
      import jax.numpy as np

      def fn(x, y, z):
        return np.dot(x, y) / z

    and

      $ cat your/thing/BUILD
      py_library(name = "prog", srcs = ["prog.py"])

    Then we can invoke this macro as follows.

      $ cat your/thing/BUILD
      load("//jax/tools:build_defs.bzl", "jax_to_ir")

      jax_to_ir(
        name = "prog_hlo",
        deps = ["//your/thing:prog"],
        fn = "your.thing.prog.fn",  # Fully-qualified module name
        input_shapes = [
          ("y", "f32[128,32]"),
          ("x", "f32[8,128]"),
        ],
        constants = {
          "z": "3.14159",
        },
        format = 'HLO',
      )

    This generates two build rules, named

      //your/thing:prog_hlo.pb
      //your/thing:prog_hlo.txt

    containing HLO proto and text representations of the JAX function.  You can
    then depend on these as data dependencies from e.g. C++.

    The parameters to the XLA program will be in the order of `input_shapes`.
    That is, the above macro will create a program which accepts parameters y
    and x, in that order.

    Starlark doesn't support floating-point numbers without a special option, so
    we need special rules to be able to pass fp values in `constants`.  Each
    dict value `v` is transformed as follows.

     - If `v` is a string, parse it as a Python literal:
       Let `v = ast.literal_eval(v)`.
     - After parsing, if `v` is a list, convert it to a numpy array:
       `v = np.asarray(v)`.

    For example:

      constants = {
        "a": "1.0"           # float 1.0
        "b": [1, 2]          # yields np.asarray([1, 2]) (ints)
        "c": "[2.0, 3.0]",   # yields np.asarray([1.0, 2.0]) (floats)
        "d": "'hello'"       # yields string "hello"

        "x": ["1.0"],        # yields array of strings, np.asarray(["1.0"])
        "y": "hello"         # illegal, use "'hello'" for a string.
      }

    Args:
      name: Name of this genrule, which will produce <name>.pb and <name>.txt.
      deps: Targets to depend on, one of which must contain the JAX function.
      fn: Fully-qualified Python name of function (e.g. "path.to.fn")
      input_shapes: List of tuples (param_name, shape), e.g.
        [("y", "f32[]"), ("x", "f32[10,20]")]. The XLA program's parameters
        will be in the order specified here.
      constants: Python dictionary mapping arg names to constant values they
        should take on, e.g. {"z": "float(3.14159")}.
      format: Either HLO or TF.
