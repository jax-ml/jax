# A ShardingSpec describes at a high level how a logical array is sharded across
# devices (each ShardedDeviceArray has a ShardingSpec, and ShardingSpecs also
# describe how to shard inputs to a parallel computation). spec_to_indices()
# encodes exactly how a given ShardingSpec is translated to device buffers, i.e.
# how the sharded array is "laid out" across devices. Given a sequence of
# devices, we shard the data across the devices in row-major order, with
# replication treated as an extra inner dimension.
#
# For example, given the logical data array [1, 2, 3, 4], if we were to
# partition this array 4 ways with a replication factor of 2, for a total of 8
# devices, the data on each device would be: [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4].
#
# This encoding is assumed by various parts of the system, e.g. generating
# replica groups for collective operations.

ArrayMapping specifies how an ndarray should map to mesh axes.

Note that the ordering is crucial for the cases when this mapping is non-injective

order of entries of the mapping determines a major-to-minor order on mesh axes,
according to which chunks of the value along the repeated dimension will be assigned.

For example, consider a mapping {'x': 1, 'y': 1} and a mesh with shape {'x': 2, 'y': 3}.
The second dimension of the value would get chunked into 6 pieces, and assigned to the
mesh in a way that treats 'y' as the fastest changing (minor) dimension. In this case,
that would mean that a flat list of chunks would get assigned to a flattened list of
mesh devices without any modifications. If the mapping was {'y': 1, 'x': 1}, then the
mesh devices ndarray would have to be transposed before flattening and assignment.

  """A ShardedDeviceArray is an ndarray sharded across devices.

  The purpose of a ShardedDeviceArray is to reduce the number of transfers when
  executing replicated computations, by allowing results to persist on the
  devices that produced them. That way dispatching a similarly replicated
  computation that consumes the same sharded memory layout does not incur any
  transfers.

  A ShardedDeviceArray represents one logical ndarray value, and simulates the
  behavior of an ndarray so that it can be treated by user code as an ndarray;
  that is, it is only an optimization to reduce transfers.

  Attributes:
    aval: A ShapedArray indicating the shape and dtype of this array.
    sharding_spec: describes how this array is sharded across `device_buffers`.
    device_buffers: the buffers containing the data for this array. Each buffer
      is the same shape and on a different device. Buffers are in row-major
      order, with replication treated as an extra innermost dimension.
    indices: the result of spec_to_indices(sharding_spec). Can optionally be
      precomputed for efficiency. A list the same length as
      `device_buffers`. Each index indicates what portion of the full array is
      stored in the corresponding device buffer, i.e. `array[indices[i]] ==
      device_buffers[i].to_py()`.

  In particular, all ``axis_names`` become valid resource names inside the
  managed block and can be used e.g. in the ``in_axis_resources`` argument of
  :py:func:`jax.experimental.pjit.pjit`. Also see JAX's multi-process programming model (https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_process.html)
  and pjit tutorial (https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/08-pjit.html).

  If you are compiling in multiple threads, make sure that the
  ``with Mesh`` context manager is inside the function that the threads will
  execute.

  Args:
    devices: A NumPy ndarray object containing JAX device objects (as
      obtained e.g. from :py:func:`jax.devices`).
    axis_names: A sequence of resource axis names to be assigned to the
      dimensions of the ``devices`` argument. Its length should match the

  Example:

    >>> from jax.experimental.maps import Mesh

    >>> from jax.experimental import PartitionSpec as P
    >>> import numpy as np
    ...
    >>> inp = np.arange(16).reshape((8, 2))

    >>> # Use the mesh object directly as a context manager.
    >>> with global_mesh:
    ...   out = pjit(lambda x: x, in_axis_resources=None, out_axis_resources=None)(inp)

    >>> # Initialize the Mesh and use the mesh as the context manager.
    >>> with Mesh(devices, ('x', 'y')) as global_mesh:
