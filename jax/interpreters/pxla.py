# A ShardingSpec describes at a high level how a logical array is sharded across
# devices (each ShardedDeviceArray has a ShardingSpec, and ShardingSpecs also
# describe how to shard inputs to a parallel computation). spec_to_indices()
# encodes exactly how a given ShardingSpec is translated to device buffers, i.e.
# how the sharded array is "laid out" across devices. Given a sequence of
# devices, we shard the data across the devices in row-major order, with
# replication treated as an extra inner dimension.
#
# For example, given the logical data array [1, 2, 3, 4], if we were to
# partition this array 4 ways with a replication factor of 2, for a total of 8
# devices, the data on each device would be: [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4].
#
# This encoding is assumed by various parts of the system, e.g. generating
# replica groups for collective operations.

ArrayMapping specifies how an ndarray should map to mesh axes.
