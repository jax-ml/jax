# A ShardingSpec describes at a high level how a logical array is sharded across
# devices (each ShardedDeviceArray has a ShardingSpec, and ShardingSpecs also
# describe how to shard inputs to a parallel computation). spec_to_indices()
# encodes exactly how a given ShardingSpec is translated to device buffers, i.e.
# how the sharded array is "laid out" across devices. Given a sequence of
# devices, we shard the data across the devices in row-major order, with
# replication treated as an extra inner dimension.
#
# For example, given the logical data array [1, 2, 3, 4], if we were to
# partition this array 4 ways with a replication factor of 2, for a total of 8
# devices, the data on each device would be: [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4].
#
# This encoding is assumed by various parts of the system, e.g. generating
# replica groups for collective operations.

"""
ArrayMapping specifies how an ndarray should map to mesh axes.

Note that the ordering is crucial for the cases when this mapping is non-injective
(i.e. when multiple mesh axes map to the same positional axis). Then, the
order of entries of the mapping determines a major-to-minor order on mesh axes,
according to which chunks of the value along the repeated dimension will be assigned.

For example, consider a mapping {'x': 1, 'y': 1} and a mesh with shape {'x': 2, 'y': 3}.
The second dimension of the value would get chunked into 6 pieces, and assigned to the
mesh in a way that treats 'y' as the fastest changing (minor) dimension. In this case,
that would mean that a flat list of chunks would get assigned to a flattened list of
mesh devices without any modifications. If the mapping was {'y': 1, 'x': 1}, then the
mesh devices ndarray would have to be transposed before flattening and assignment.
