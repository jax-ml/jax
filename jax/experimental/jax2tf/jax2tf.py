  """Transforms `fun` to be executed by TensorFlow.

  See
  [README](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/experimental/jax2tf/README.md)
  for more details about usage and common problems.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be transformed. Its arguments and return value should be
      JAX arrays, or nested standard Python containers (tuple/list/dict) thereof
      (pytrees).
    polymorphic_shapes: Specifies input shapes to be treated polymorphically
      during conversion.

      .. warning:: The shape-polymorphic conversion is an experimental feature.
        It is meant to be sound, but it is known to reject some JAX programs
        that are shape polymorphic. The details of this feature can change.

      It should be `None` (all arguments are monomorphic), a single PolyShape
      or string (applies to all arguments), or a tuple/list of the same length
      as the function arguments. For each argument the shape specification
      should be `None` (monomorphic argument), or a Python object with the
      same pytree structure as the argument.
      See [how optional parameters are matched to
      arguments](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html#applying-optional-parameters-to-pytrees).

      A shape specification for an array argument should be an object
      `PolyShape(dim0, dim1, ..., dimn)`
      where each `dim` is a dimension specification: a positive integer denoting
      a monomorphic dimension of the given size, or a string denoting a
      dimension variable assumed to range over non-zero dimension sizes, or
      the special placeholder string "_" denoting a monomorphic dimension
      whose size is given by the actual argument. As a shortcut, an Ellipsis
      suffix in the list of dimension specifications stands for a list of "_"
      placeholders.

      For convenience, a shape specification can also be given as a string
      representation, e.g.: "batch, ...", "batch, height, width, _", possibly
      with surrounding parentheses: "(batch, ...)".

      The conversion fails if it cannot ensure that the it would produce the same
      sequence of TF ops for any non-zero values of the dimension variables.

      polymorphic_shapes are only supported for positional arguments; shape
      polymorphism is not supported for keyword arguments.

      See [the README](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/experimental/jax2tf/README.md#shape-polymorphic-conversion)
      for more details.

    in_shapes: DEPRECATED in favor of `polymorphic_shapes`.
    with_gradient: if set (default), add a tf.custom_gradient to the converted
      function, by converting the ``jax.vjp(fun)``. This means that reverse-mode
      TensorFlow AD is supported for the output TensorFlow function, and the
      value of the gradient will be JAX-accurate.
    enable_xla: if set (default), the converter will use the simplest conversion
      and use XLA TF ops when necessary. These ops are known to create issues
      for the TFLite and TFjs converters. For those cases, unset this parameter
      so the converter tries harder to use non-XLA TF ops to convert the
      function and aborts if this is not possible.

  Returns:
    A version of `fun` that expects TfVals as arguments (or
    tuple/lists/dicts) thereof, and returns TfVals as outputs, and uses
    only TensorFlow ops.

  For jax2tf purposes we want to avoid needing to thread the `strategy` object

      dimension, specifying in how many parts the dimension should be split. The
