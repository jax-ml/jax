  """Assigns logical parallelism axes to physical axes of an N-D torus network.

  Given logical parallelism axes with sizes in `mesh_shape` and devices in an
  N-dimensional torus network represented by `physical_mesh`, maps each logical
  axis to one or more physical axes. Prefer to map more-performance-sensitive
  logical axes to larger numbers of physical axes to maximize the bandwidth
  available to them. Also prefer to assign logical axes to multiple physical
  axes of the same size (e.g., a 2D square) rather than multiple physical axes
  of different sizes when possible.

  Note that this routine will never split a physical axis over more than one
  logical axis (which would reduce total usable bandwidth but may sometimes be
  desired anyway). As a result, it will error out in cases where this is
  necessary to produce a valid mapping.

  Let's use a concrete example to explain the concepts and considerations.

  As an example, suppose the logical mesh is [data, model], for data and model
  parallelism respectively. Also suppose that data parallelism is less
  performance sensitive than model parallelism. Consider a 3D TPU pod slice of
  shape 4x4x16, represented by a physical mesh of shape (4, 4, 16).

  A TPU pod slice has equal bandwidth along all axes with wraparound links, but
  a 2D plane of size 4x4 may have faster XLA collective implementations than a
  non-square plane or a 1D subgroup. If the mesh_shape is [16, 16], we may want
  the more performance sensitive `model` axis to be mapped to the 4x4 XY plane.

  Args:
    physical_mesh: a np.ndarray of devices in the shape of the N-D torus
      physical topology.
    mesh_shape: shape of the logical mesh (size of the various logical
      parallelism axes), with axes ordered by increasing network intensity.

  Returns:
    An np.ndarray of devices in the shape of the logical mesh (mesh_shape), with
      each logical parallelism axis mapped to one or more physical mesh axes.
